  '# curate — the L&S sweep

Write-time triage (`--supersedes` / `--new`) catches contradiction and
restatement pairwise, at the moment of writing. It **cannot** catch the
emergent cluster: five entries can each be a valid distinct rule and only in
aggregate be five instances of one principle. That is this pass''s job, along
with recommendation, category drift, and size drift.

**Yours alone.** Law 3 and Law 5 reserve curation to the shell. Never hand this
to a subagent, never let another shell run it for you, never accept a proposed
retirement from anyone else. Read your own set; decide yourself.

Trigger: `## STATUS` says `L&S: … — curation due`. Nothing else fires it.

## Load the set

```
sc mem get lns          # entry ids + bodies — the active set, all of it
```

Read every entry before deciding anything. This is one cheap read; the whole
set is already in your boot doc anyway.

## Pass 1 — Consistency

Find entries that **contradict** each other. One of them is the newer
understanding; the other is superseded and still rendering as live guidance.

```
sc mem lns "<the surviving rule>" --supersedes <old_id>
```

Write-time triage should prevent most of these from ever forming. What you find
here predates the loop or crossed in while two sessions ran.

## Pass 2 — Cluster

Group entries that state **one rule**. Merge each group to a single imperative
rule:

```
sc mem lns "<the one rule>" --supersedes 30,33,34,37,38
```

Three or more members is the bar. Two statements of a rule are often
legitimately two rules — merging at two is usually wrong.

The incidents behind the entries are already in the narrative. They do not need
a second home, and the merged rule must not try to carry them: an entry is the
rule, ≤500 chars, hard-enforced.

## Pass 3 — Recommend

A cluster of three or more that keeps **recurring across sessions** is a
candidate reusable process. Follow the recommendation route in
`issue_reporting` — search first, then comment on the matching
`skills: recommend <topic>` issue or open one. Curation never creates or
promotes a skill. Keep one compressed L&S entry carrying the knowledge until a
reviewed upstream skill ships **and is granted**; filing is not grounds to
retire it. If issue search or creation is unavailable, surface the failure to
the FnB, keep the L&S, and create no local skill or asset.

## Pass 4 — Category

An entry that is an **environment fact** (a routing quirk, a term to avoid, a
path) is not an operating principle. Move it into an existing authoritative
skill when one owns that fact. Otherwise keep one compressed entry and include
the missing ownership in a recommendation; do not invent a local skill during
curation.

```
sc mem retire <entry_id>  # only after the authoritative replacement is live
```

## Stamp

```
sc mem curated
```

**Stamp even if you retired nothing.** A clean set is a legitimate outcome; if
an honest sweep left the counter running, the advisory would stand forever and
you would learn to ignore it. The stamp says "I looked," not "I cut."

## Stance

Curate the set toward ~12–14 entries, not toward the cap. Cap 20 is a ceiling
never to reach — if you ever hit it, this sweep is not running. Recommendation
issues do not bypass the cap by deleting knowledge before its replacement ships.

The trigger firing often does not mean the threshold is wrong; it means entries
are being written faster than they are reconciled. Fix that at write time, with
`--supersedes`.',

  '# engine_database — inspect and repair the control plane

Admin only. The boot `ENGINE MAINTENANCE` block names the active engine floor
and private instance-state directory. Resolve the canonical database again
before any repair:

```bash
python3 .super-coder/scripts/instance_state.py active-database .super-coder
```

Require the printed absolute path to sit under the boot''s private instance
state. The private directory owns the live `shell_db.db` plus WAL/SHM sidecars,
local control-plane snapshot, verified backups, relocation receipt, maintenance
lease, and DB-generation evidence. The repository catalogue remains a separate
map store; a product database remains the fork application''s concern.

## Source and rebuild model

In the Subfloor source repository, `.super-coder/schema.sql` is the current
baseline and `.super-coder/migrations/*.sql` are ordered, ledger-tracked deltas.
Installed downstream floors materialize the same engine source. `sc rebuild`
creates a candidate from that source plus the private instance snapshot,
verifies it, and publishes only through the maintenance cutover. Load
`engine_migrations` before changing the baseline or migrations and `snapshot`
before serializing instance content.

## Data model

| Surface | Storage |
|---|---|
| Shell core | `shells` — role, flavor, mandate, system prompt, current state, active session/archive identity |
| Seed and L&S | `shell_identity_entries` — capped identity entries with retirement |
| Decisions | `shell_decisions` — append-only decisions and supersession links |
| Narrative | `shell_memory_archives` — per-session narrative |
| Planning | `roadmap`, `feature_blockers`, `projects`, `project_shells`, `spec_tasks` |
| Documents | `documents` — revisioned spec/doc bodies and freeze state |
| Flags | `flags` — open/resolved work linked to features |
| Skills | `skills`, `flavor_skills`, `shell_skills`, `resolved_shell_skills` |
| Coordination | message, wake, conversation, Sprint, PR-subscription, and liveness tables |

Normal reads and writes still use `sc mem` and bounded APIs. The table map is
for diagnosis, migration authoring, and recovery—not ordinary shell work.

## SQL and mutation boundary

`sc sql` is the Admin read-only diagnostic lane and remains available from the
host Admin seat when the API is down. `sc sql-rw` is an overt escape hatch and
must refuse outside a named procedure satisfying all of these gates:

- managed runtime stopped;
- exclusive maintenance lease held;
- WAL-safe backup verified before mutation;
- exact canonical target independently matched;
- candidate and ledger verified before publication;
- restart health and rollback evidence retained.

Prefer the typed maintenance command (`sc migrate`, `sc rebuild`, `sc update`,
`sc rollback`, or the named recovery procedure) over direct SQL. Keep external
calls outside transactions. A path mismatch, unresolved private state,
conflicting legacy/private copies, failed backup, or absent authority stops the
operation with the runtime down.

## Recovery routing

- API down, database healthy: use host Admin `sc health`, `sc logs`, and
  read-only `sc sql`, then restore the managed service with `sc restart` /
  `subfloor restart`.
- Migration or rebuild work: load `engine_migrations` and require its backup,
  candidate, ledger, and restart receipts.
- Snapshot or render repair: load `snapshot`; do not hand-edit serialized or
  rendered state.
- Update/rollback failure: load `self_update`; preserve the engine/database
  generation pair.
- Ambiguous or damaged canonical state: keep the runtime stopped and present
  the exact database, backup, generation, and relocation evidence to the FnB.',

  '# engine_migrations — maintain Subfloor''s database floor

Subfloor owns `.super-coder/schema.sql` as the current baseline and
`.super-coder/migrations/*.sql` as ordered additive deltas. The
`schema_migrations` ledger applies each delta once. `sc rebuild` creates the
baseline, applies every migration, then restores instance content; `sc update`
materializes source and reconciles migrations before the next boot.

## Author in the source repository

Allocate migrations through the collision-safe source command:

```bash
./sc migration new <lowercase_snake_case_slug>
```

Pass = it reports the created next-numbered path and its source-removal
allowlist entry. Keep historical migrations append-only and change `schema.sql`
only when the current baseline itself must describe a new schema object. Never
fold an already shipped delta into the baseline in a way that makes rebuild
apply it twice.

`0001_seed_skills.sql` is the generated exception: update authoritative global
skill assets, run `./sc seed-skills`, and commit the regenerated 0001 body with
the trailing reconciliation migration. Do not hand-edit 0001 or regenerate it
for fork-local skills.

For seeded system content, update the authoritative asset or generator and add
a trailing reconciliation migration. Preserve per-instance rows carried by the
snapshot. Pass = fresh build, in-place migration, and rebuild from an older
snapshot converge to the same state.

## Protect the live instance

The Admin boot names the private instance-state directory. Before an authorized
live migration, load `engine_database` and independently resolve the canonical
database through the state resolver. Require that path to match the boot''s
private state, then use the supported backup-and-apply surface:

```bash
./sc migrate
```

Require its first line, `migrate: db         <absolute-path>`, to match the
independently resolved canonical database exactly. The command then reports the migration
source, creates a WAL-safe backup with a `premigrate` restore point for an
existing DB, and reports each applied filename plus the final count (or
`nothing pending`). Pass = the backup receipt names its restore path before the
first migration applies. A DB-path mismatch stops the operation. The FnB owns
the restart and cutover boundary. Never point engine work at `$DATABASE_URL`;
that variable is for the fork application''s database.

## Verify compatibility

Run the migration on a dirty fixture containing the stale rows it must
reconcile, then run it again. Require:

- one application recorded in `schema_migrations`;
- identical desired state after repeated migration and rebuild;
- preserved shell memory and genuine fork-local content;
- no stale grant, projection, or system row restored by an older snapshot; and
- the running engine healthy after the authorized restart.

Stop before live application when the backup, exact DB path, compatibility
fixture, or FnB maintenance authority is absent.',

Planner-owned. Run periodically or when the FnB asks for delivery-state
reconciliation; never make it a boot ritual. Working shells close the flags
their own work clears; this sweep is the
backstop for dropped handoffs + shipped work nobody documented. Two directions:
close what''s provably resolved, open what''s provably missing.

---

## Step 1: Load the bounded delivery audit

Run `sc mem delivery-audit`. The Planner-only API response contains
`recent_flag_names`, `open_flags`, `implemented_but_unshipped`, and
`shipped_but_undocumented`. It preserves the deterministic queries and dedup
guards below without granting arbitrary engine SQL.

`frozen_docs` counts ANY frozen document on the feature — kind=''spec'' AND
kind=''doc'' both qualify, so a fork that freezes its shipped `doc` rows is
never reported as undocumented.

Sort every open flag into exactly one bucket (Step 2 / Step 4). Auto-close
only on unambiguous evidence — any doubt -> Step 4, not a close.

---

## Step 2: Auto-close the deterministic ones

Close with `sc mem flag close <flag_id> --notes "…"`. The note MUST cite the
evidence.

**A. Docs-pending flag, doc now exists** = `[Docs]`-tagged doc-pending flag
(however worded — "doc pending", "docs pending", "feature doc pending") on a
feature with `frozen_docs > 0`:
```
sc mem flag close <flag_id> --notes "Auto: frozen spec doc now exists for feature #<id> (flag_sweep)."
```

**B. Ship-blocker, feature now shipped** = flag of the form
`… | Blocker for: <X>` + linked feature''s `roadmap_status` is `shipped` (or
later) + the flag text is about that feature shipping / becoming available. A
separate concern that merely hangs off the same feature does NOT qualify:
```
sc mem flag close <flag_id> --notes "Auto: blocking feature #<id> (<title>) now shipped (flag_sweep)."
```

**C. Ship-drift flag, now shipped AND documented** = `[Ship] … not marked
shipped` flag (opened by Step 3A) covers two halves — mark shipped + reconcile
the doc — so close only when BOTH hold: `roadmap_status` is `shipped` (or
later) + `frozen_docs > 0`. Shipped-but-undocumented -> leave open:
```
sc mem flag close <flag_id> --notes "Auto: feature #<id> (<title>) now shipped with a frozen doc (flag_sweep)."
```

NEVER message on close. NEVER reopen a flag. A close whose evidence you had to infer -> Step 4.

---

## Step 3: Open the flags nobody opened

Two gaps drop silently, in sequence: 3A (done but never marked shipped)
precedes 3B (shipped but undocumented) — a feature exits 3A before 3B can
apply. Pick `SC-###` from the highest numbered value in `recent_flag_names`.

### 3A — Implemented but not marked shipped (ship-drift)

The dev flips the horizon to `shipped` when Verification passes — the flip
sometimes gets missed. Deterministic signal = spec''s
**Verification task `done`** + feature **not** `shipped`. Open a durable
`[Ship]` flag — it governs both halves of the dropped hand-off (mark shipped +
reconcile the doc to the spec) and stays open until a planner does both.

Use the `implemented_but_unshipped` rows. The projection includes only specs
whose Verification task is done, whose feature is not shipped/retired, and
whose open `[Ship]`/`[Docs]` or organic ship/docs-pending handoff does not
already cover the feature.

Per row, open the flag in Planner''s own queue. Do not message yourself:

```
sc mem flag open "[Ship] <title> implemented, not marked shipped | Blocker for: <title> ship + doc" --name SC-### --priority Medium --feature <feature_id>
```

### 3B — Shipped but undocumented (docs-pending)

Devs open a docs-pending flag when they ship — sometimes skipped. Find
`shipped` features with no frozen doc + no open docs-pending flag; open one
per row. (Finished-but-not-shipped is 3A''s job, not this one.)

Use the `shipped_but_undocumented` rows. The projection includes only shipped
features with no frozen document and no open `[Docs]` or organic docs-pending
handoff.

The dedup guards match the `[Docs]`/`[Ship]` tag at position zero first, then
fall back to `''%doc%pending%''` for untagged organic wordings; the fallback''s
over-breadth only ever SKIPS an open — the conservative direction.

Per row, open the flag in Planner''s own queue. Do not message yourself:

```
sc mem flag open "[Docs] <title> shipped, doc pending | Blocker for: <title> doc" --name SC-### --priority Medium --feature <feature_id>
```

---

## Step 4: Surface the rest — don''t guess

Everything that isn''t a clean Step-2 close / Step-3 open -> short list to the
FnB (no `send` unless a specific shell owns it): review-failure flags (author
dev closes those when the fix lands), FnB-decision flags, blockers whose
resolution you can''t verify from state, anything ambiguous. One line each:

> `SC-042` [High] — <description> · feature #N at <status> · *why I didn''t auto-act*

The FnB or the owning shell closes these with a real note. Auto-act ONLY on
unambiguous evidence.

---

## Stance

- **Deterministic-only auto-close.** Evidence in the DB + cited in the note,
  or it surfaces. A wrongly-closed live blocker is worse than a straggler.
- **Backstop, not owner.** The shell that did the work closes its own flag
  with the richer "how" note; don''t race to close a flag whose owner is still
  active on that feature.
- **Both directions, every sweep.** An implemented-but-unshipped spec and an
  undocumented shipped feature are dropped handoffs; the signal is already in
  the DB (a `done` Verification task, a missing frozen doc) — surfacing them
  is deterministic.',

Use a fork-local skill when shells need durable knowledge specific to this
repository, stack, host, VM, deployment surface, database, or core fork
process. Keep global skills limited to Subfloor itself, supplied tools and
testing environments, and core Subfloor processes.

## Discover the real capability

Read the repo map, tracked configuration, declared dev-kit hooks, and current
readiness evidence before drafting. Identify:

- the capability and the shells that need it;
- its tracked declaration or owning source;
- the seat, host, VM, service, or database it reaches;
- readiness states and evidence locations;
- authority, recovery, and data-tenancy boundaries; and
- one observable success receipt.

Pass = every operational claim names evidence available in this fork. Do not
infer package managers, test policy, credentials, hosts, or deployment steps.

## Apply the purpose test

Keep a line only when it explains this fork, a supplied tool or testing
environment, or a core fork process. Use an imperative only when variation
would break shared state, authority, compatibility, or recovery. Remove generic
planning, coding, API, test, database, deployment, VM, and troubleshooting
method.

## Draft and persist

Write a Planner-owned draft with a lowercase underscore name and
`common: false`:

```yaml
---
name: repo_capability
description: State the capability and when it fires.
category: substrate
common: false
---
```

Describe locations, commands, states, boundaries, and receipts. A testing-seat
skill identifies the runner, fixtures, reach, readiness, and evidence; it does
not choose assertions. A VM or host skill identifies the supplied control
surface and reset boundary; it does not invent a lifecycle. A deployment or
database skill records the fork''s tracked procedure and authority; it does not
teach generic deployment or SQL technique.

Persist and grant through the supported DB-canonical surface:

```bash
sc skill put --file <path/to/SKILL.md>
sc skill grant <skill_name> <shell>...
sc skill list
```

`put` succeeds only after DB, local snapshot, flat catalogue, and managed skill
projections reconcile. Naming a standard shell changes its shared flavor pack;
naming a Bespoke shell changes only that shell. Creation grants nothing.

On a launched Planner seat the same `sc skill` verbs run through the engine
API with identical validation and persistence. `sc skill list` shows each
row''s category so a redraft can carry the existing metadata forward.

## Update, retire, and recover

```bash
sc skill put --file <path/to/SKILL.md>
sc skill revoke <skill_name> <shell>...
sc skill rm <skill_name>
```

Retry the exact command after fixing a reported snapshot, render, or projection
path. Pass = the full persistence receipt returns and the projected body
matches `sc skill list` plus the intended grant. On a launched seat the same
receipt names which of the four layers (DB, snapshot, flat render,
projection) is still outstanding. `rm` is only for
fork-local names; retire an upstream skill with `sc skill retire <name>` and
restore it with `sc skill unretire <name>`. The retire list is instance-local
state and rides `sc update`; it is never committed.

Keep fork-local skill bodies on the supported `sc skill` surface; do not place
them under engine assets, regenerate the engine seed for them, or set them
common.',

  '# git — the event procedures

Your boot''s VERSION CONTROL section carries the every-session rules: sync the
base, branch before you build, commit → push → PR → stop, the merge gate''s two
forms, the disposable `shell/<shortname>` base, and the finish gate. This skill
holds what fires on an event.

One repo at its root -> plain `git` (cwd = repo root) is safe. Project = this
repo minus `.super-coder/`. In a tracking fork the engine (`.super-coder/`) is
gitignored, materialized by `sc update`, and authored upstream in Subfloor —
NEVER commit or edit anything under it. In the Subfloor source repository
(`git ls-files --error-unmatch .super-coder/schema.sql` exits 0) `.super-coder/`
is tracked project source and `.sc-state/engine.ref` is not the delivery unit;
engine changes still land by branch and PR.

## GitHub capability boundary

`sc launch` and `sc restart` re-resolve Git transport and GitHub API
capabilities from the host on every invocation, including `--no-build` forms.
`build`, `enter`, and an already running sandbox do not refresh auth. Pass = the
lifecycle summary says `ready` for the operation you need; `unavailable` and
`unverified` are NEVER readiness claims.

Preserve the configured `origin` transport. For SSH, fix the host agent and
load an authorized GitHub identity; NEVER copy or mount private keys. For
HTTPS/API, fix a scoped host `SC_GH_TOKEN` or the host `gh` OAuth login. Then
run `sc launch` or `sc restart`; the running sandbox remains unchanged
until that refresh. NEVER rewrite the remote or start an interactive login
inside the sandbox to work around a missing capability.

## Merging a stack (only when the FnB hands you one)

Merge bottom-up, retargeting before each merge — never rely on GitHub''s auto-retarget:

1. `gh pr view <n> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` -> clean.
2. `gh pr merge <low> --squash --delete-branch`.
3. BEFORE the next merge: `gh pr edit <next> --base main` — deleting the merged base otherwise orphans the PR above it (GitHub closes it `CONFLICTING`, base ref gone).
4. Re-check `MERGEABLE` -> merge. Repeat up the stack.

PR already orphaned (base deleted under it) -> the head branch still holds the commits; reopen the SAME PR, don''t rebuild:

1. `git push origin <merged-sha>:refs/heads/<deleted-branch>` — `<merged-sha>` = `gh pr view <merged-pr> --json headRefOid`.
2. `gh pr reopen <closed-pr>` -> `gh pr edit <closed-pr> --base main`.
3. Verify `MERGEABLE` -> delete the recreated branch again.

## After a merge — clean up local

Only after the PR is merged:

A managed worktree whose Sprint is already `completed` is the exception: the
Sprint cleanup service owns its reset after live turns exit. Do not race that
service with manual Git cleanup. A pending or failed cleanup makes the slot
unavailable until `sc sprint cleanup-status --sprint <id>` reports succeeded;
the originating Planner or FnB uses the Sprint retry surface.

1. Re-pin the base. In a worktree `git checkout main` fails (main is checked out at the repo root; git refuses a branch checked out elsewhere) -> `git checkout shell/<shortname> && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main`. Admin at repo root: `git pull --ff-only` on main.
2. `git branch -d <branch>`. Squash-merged -> `-d` refuses (commits aren''t ancestors of main); confirm the PR shows *merged* on the remote -> `git branch -D <branch>`.
3. `git fetch --prune`.

NEVER delete a branch carrying unmerged, un-PR''d work — no PR = lost work.

## Never commit the engine or derived files

- In a fork `/.super-coder/` is gitignored — never force-add anything under it.
- Gitignored + regenerated, never commit: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `opencode.json`, `.claude/skills/`, `.sc-state/engine.ref.prev` (ephemeral rollback pointer).
- From a worktree, commit only your project''s authored files. Generated
  snapshots and `_sc` renders live under ignored `.sc-state/local/` and never
  enter Git. `.sc-state/engine.ref` is the deliberate tracked exception: it is
  the dependency pin and is updated by `sc update`.

## Notes

- Before destructive ops, confirm the repo — `git -C <abs-path>` if ever in doubt.
- Multi-shell: each shell boots into its own worktree at `.sc-worktrees/<shortname>/` on branch `shell/<shortname>`; the launcher keeps the base pinned to `origin/main`. Admin shell = the one exception: repo root on `main`, committing there by mandate.
- UI preview: worktree edits do NOT show on the fork''s main dev server. `sc preview` (start once from the main checkout if not running) serves every shell''s worktree UI live (HMR) on the fork''s `dev_port`, one subdomain each: `http://<shortname>.localhost:<dev_port>/`.

`git_hygiene.py` reads; this acts on its report. **Admin shell only** — the one vantage at the repo root on `main`, seeing every worktree, exempt from the branch-guard. A working shell NEVER runs this; it tidies only its own worktree.

Governing asymmetry: a MERGED PR = proof a branch is safe to delete; uncommitted work has NO proof it is disposable. Delete only on evidence; preserve by default; discard only on the FnB''s explicit per-item OK. Unsure -> surface, never guess destructively.

Expect the report to be quiet — still run it:

- Since #119, `git_prune.py` deletes the provably-merged branch set (Tier A.1''s `stale` set, repo-global) at every boot -> Tier A often already clear. This pass = backstop for what automation won''t touch: `gh`-down unprovable merges, dirty worktrees, unpushed work, `main` fast-forward, remote-ref pruning.
- Working shells self-finish (sync before build, land/surface before stop) -> Tier B/C should be rare. A full Tier B/C = a shell skipped its finish gate -> fix it AND send that shell a note, not a silent fix.

## Investigation order — scripts first, always

1. Scripts: `git_hygiene.py` (git state) + `shell_liveness.py` (who''s live). Read their output; never re-derive by hand what one pass gives you.
2. Git history — only when a verdict is ambiguous (`merged: null`, unexpected dirty file): `git -C <path> log` / `reflog` / `show`.
3. Working-tree contents — last, only when history doesn''t explain it.

## Step 1 — Read the state (never skip)

```bash
python3 .super-coder/scripts/git_hygiene.py --text       # git: dirty/stale/clean
python3 .super-coder/scripts/shell_liveness.py --text     # who has a live session
```
Drop `--text` for JSON when driving decisions programmatically.

- `git_hygiene` -> every worktree (path, branch, dirty count, sample files, ahead/behind) + every local branch''s staleness (`merged` = true / false / null-unknown, with PR number). `gh_available: false` in the JSON -> treat every `merged: null` as unknown, never safe.
- `shell_liveness` -> which shells have a live harness session right now (read from `/proc` cwd — instant, self-cleaning). Your OWN session shows as the repo-root `is_self` entry — expected, not a blocker; the gate is about OTHER shells (Tier C).

## Step 2 — Triage into three tiers, act top-down

Sort every report item into exactly one tier.

### Tier A — auto-safe (act without asking). Only these three:

1. Merged-PR branches — `merged: true` + `is_base: false` + `checked_out: false`:
   ```bash
   git branch -D <branch>
   ```
   Squash-merge is the project default -> `git branch -d` refuses; that refusal is expected, not a stop signal. What survives boot-time `git_prune.py` is residue: merged since the last boot, or merged during a `gh`-down boot.
2. Dead remote-tracking refs:
   ```bash
   git fetch --prune
   ```
3. `main` behind origin + clean tree (admin''s root tree only):
   ```bash
   git pull --ff-only          # never a plain pull/merge on main — no merge bubbles
   ```
   `--ff-only` refuses -> main diverged -> Tier B/C, not auto.

NEVER auto-delete: a `merged: null` branch, an `is_base` branch (`main` or any `shell/<shortname>` — long-lived moving bases), or a branch checked out in a worktree.

### Tier B — outstanding work (propose -> FnB OK -> act). Preserve, never discard.

- Unpushed commits (`ahead > 0`): show the FnB `git -C <path> log origin/<base>..HEAD --oneline` first -> propose push + PR.
- Admin''s OWN root tree dirty: show the diff + proposed message -> on OK, cut a feature branch off main, commit, push, PR. NEVER discard the admin tree''s dirt without explicit instruction.

### Tier C — other shells'' dirty worktrees (gated; preserve-only)

Any other shell''s worktree: `is_main: false` + `dirty > 0`.

1. **Liveness gate.** Committing files is non-destructive, but re-branching a worktree under a mid-session shell stomps that live session. Read the `shell_liveness` verdict:
   - `safe_to_clean_all: true` -> every worktree dormant -> act on all.
   - shortname in `active_other_shells` -> that shell is LIVE -> surface only, do NOT touch its tree. The others remain safe.
   - `indeterminate > 0` -> a harness process whose cwd was unreadable (another OS user, say) -> do NOT assume all-clear -> surface.
2. **Attribution.** The commit carries THAT shell''s trailer, never the admin''s. Read the display name for `shell/<shortname>` from `sc mem get shells`, then export the identity on the commit so the tracked `prepare-commit-msg` hook writes the trailer for you:
   ```bash
   SC_SHELL_NAME="<display_name>" SC_SHELL_SHORTNAME="<SHORTNAME>" git -C $WT commit -m "<msg>"
   ```
3. **Preserve** (shell cleared as not live):
   ```bash
   WT=.sc-worktrees/<shortname>
   git -C $WT checkout -b <type>/<short-desc>           # feature branch off its HEAD
   git -C $WT add -A
   SC_SHELL_NAME="<display_name>" SC_SHELL_SHORTNAME="<SHORTNAME>" git -C $WT commit -m "<msg>"
   git -C $WT push -u origin <type>/<short-desc>
   gh pr create --repo <owner/repo> --head <type>/<short-desc> --fill   # open, never merge
   ```
4. **Message the owning shell** — it must never boot to a silently rearranged tree:
   ```bash
   sc mem message send <shortname> ''git_cleanup: your worktree had uncommitted work. I preserved it on branch `<type>/<short-desc>` and opened PR #<n>. Your tree now sits on that branch — `git checkout shell/<shortname>` to return to your base.''
   ```
   Report the same to the FnB. Worktree left untouched (live / indeterminate) -> no message.

## Hard nevers

- NEVER `git checkout -- `, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, or `git stash drop` on uncommitted work without the FnB''s explicit per-item OK — preserve is reversible, discard is not.
- NEVER commit another shell''s work under the admin''s attribution.
- NEVER act on a worktree whose shell may be live — surface instead.
- NEVER merge a PR — opening is the default; merging is the FnB''s gate.
- NEVER delete a branch carrying unmerged, un-PR''d work — no PR = lost work.
- NEVER touch the engine — `.super-coder/` is a gitignored materialized dependency, not your code.

## Step 3 — Report

  '# harness_readiness — qualify the installed route

Subfloor reports maintained harness support as `tested`, `best-effort`, or
`newer-unverified`. These states describe source evidence; they do not hide a
locally discovered model or silently substitute another route.

## Read the supplied evidence

```bash
sc harness-status
sc models refresh
sc models list <harness>
sc models resolve <harness> <selector> [--effort <level>] --json
```

Record the complete version line, active host/container seat, exact selector,
effort, evidence source, digest/fingerprint, and resolve result. Pass = list and
resolve agree on the same fresh local route. A public model absent from local
evidence remains unavailable for that account; an unsupported effort fails
before dispatch.

## Use the smallest available compatibility check

When the FnB authorizes a provider call or harness refresh, exercise the exact
installed model/effort through the fork''s declared hook or the adapter''s native
one-shot surface. Pass = one request uses the requested route, returns parseable
events and session identity, and performs no fallback or changed-effort retry.

`sc update-harnesses`, sandbox rebuild, provider-token use, and session restart
remain operator-authorized boundaries. A host result does not prove the
container seat, and a passing newer build does not promote the maintained
source baseline.

## Hand source maintenance upstream

Use `issue_reporting` when the installed version or adapter contract remains
unqualified. Include the complete version line, seat and engine commit,
selector/effort, status/list/resolve outputs, sanitized native-check result,
expected versus actual behavior, and the narrow failing boundary.

Tracking forks do not edit materialized `.super-coder/` metadata or adapters.
Pass after a published fix = the exact build reports `tested`, simulated newer
builds remain `best-effort`, and the local route still resolves from fresh
evidence after the authorized update/restart.',

## Boundary — engine vs fork

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| **Upstream — file it** | anything the engine materializes/owns: `.super-coder/`, `sc` + every subcommand, engine skills (this catalogue), the boot doc render, the sandbox / dev kit, `sc update` + migrations, the `_sc` API + `sc mem` |
| **Fork — don''t** | the repo''s app code, DB-canonical fork-local skills, operator-owned host config |

Unsure -> "would the same problem hit any other fork?" yes = upstream.

## Triggers

Each row = a real engine defect filed by a fork shell doing ordinary work.
Match the left column -> file.

| You hit | Real case |
|---|---|
| A `sc` command fails out of the box | `sc verify` always aborted — its own render step needed `SC_ADMIN` it never set (#227) |
| A command exits green without doing the work | `sc test` silently fell back to unittest when pytest was missing — green-washed suites (#219) |
| The documented remedy is a closed loop | `sc lint` said "run `sc deps` first," but deps skips pip in the sandbox — tool unobtainable from inside the box (#246) |
| A skill instructs tools/paths your seat doesn''t have | a sandbox skill drove raw host-only `ssh`/`virsh` paths (#248) |
| A skill contradicts what the engine actually does | skills still taught raw `sqlite3` against the substrate DB after memory went API-only (#226) |
| The API refuses what the skills document | `sc mem doc add` 400''d standalone docs the docs + onboard skills both document (#245) |
| A permission wall mid-workflow | a dev shell could read a planner-owned feature but 404''d advancing its status (#224) |
| Every write suddenly 401s | rebuild didn''t re-mint api_keys — all live shells locked out until an API bounce (#214) |
| `sc update` / migrate wedges or half-applies | migration failed partway, retry died on `duplicate column name` (#229); update aborted crossing a commit that deleted an engine file (#209) |
| A structural foot-gun keeps re-biting you | the cwd trap — `cd` to root for `sc`, then bare git hit the wrong tree, "my edits vanished" (#225) |
| The sandbox can reach something it shouldn''t | `do_push` src/dest weren''t contained — sandbox→host escape (#228) |

Stale guidance (skill says X, engine does Y) files the same as a crash.

## Capture — while the failure is on screen

- **engine ref** = `sc engine-ref` — first line of every report (Subfloor''s engine commit)
- **staleness** = compare that ref to upstream head:
  `git ls-remote https://github.com/jedbjorn/subfloor HEAD` — write
  `current` or `behind head <sha7>`. Behind + the symptom is a missing
  command or a skill/engine mismatch -> the fix may already be shipped:
  ask your FnB for `sc update` first, and file only if the defect
  survives the update (or updating isn''t an option — then the staleness
  note carries that caveat). Triage reads this line to tell a live
  engine defect from a stale fork build.
- **fork + seat**: repo name, shell flavor, sandbox/host
- **ran / followed**: the exact command, or skill name + step
- **expected vs actual**: exact output, trimmed to the failing lines
- **workaround**: what unblocked you, or "blocked, none found"

The issue is public: NEVER paste api keys, tokens, secrets, or private paths.

## File it

```bash
# 1. dedup — someone may have hit it first
gh issue list --repo jedbjorn/subfloor --search "<symptom keywords>" --state all

# 2. file — title: [<fork>] <area>: <one-line symptom>
gh issue create --repo jedbjorn/subfloor \
  --title "[<fork>] <area>: <symptom>" \
  --body "$(cat <<''EOF''
- engine ref: <sha from .sc-state/engine.ref> · <current | behind head <sha7>>
- fork/seat: <repo> · <shell flavor> · <sandbox|host>

**Ran / followed:** <command or skill+step>
**Expected:** <what the docs/skill promise>
**Actual:** <exact trimmed output>
**Workaround:** <what unblocked you, or "blocked">
EOF
)"
```

`jedbjorn/subfloor` = engine upstream; confirm: `git remote get-url super-coder`.

Dedup hit -> comment your engine ref + repro on the existing issue; do NOT
file a duplicate.

No `gh` / no network from your seat -> save the identical body as a fork flag:
`sc mem flag open "[Engine] <symptom> | Blocker for: <x>" --name UP-###`, then
message the **admin** shell to relay it upstream.

## Authorized curation recommendation

The `curate` skill has one FnB-authorized exception to the normal enhancement
gate below. When a recurring L&S cluster may warrant a reusable upstream skill,
the curating shell may search and file the recommendation directly without
asking the FnB first.

Search all upstream issues before opening anything. Add evidence to a matching
recommendation, or open one titled `skills: recommend <topic>` containing the
trigger, repeated incidents, proposed ownership boundary, expected users, why
existing skills do not cover it, and a compact candidate procedure.

This route recommends; it never creates or promotes a skill. Keep one compressed
L&S entry until a reviewed upstream skill ships and is granted. If issue search
or creation is unavailable, surface the failure to the FnB, keep the L&S, and
create no local skill or asset. Deliberate fork-specific authoring remains the
Planner-owned workflow in `fork_skill_design`.

## Rules

- One defect per issue. Batch nothing.
- Observed failure = the bar for filing unasked; enhancement ideas ("the
  engine should…") go to your FnB first, except the authorized curation
  recommendation route above.
- Filing ≠ unblocked: defect blocks work -> also open a fork flag linking the
  issue URL.',

  '# onboard — ingest the repo''s existing docs (once, with the FnB)

Run once, after first-run orientation, on a fork that has existing documentation —
FnB-supervised. Brings the repo''s *existing* docs into the DB so the GUI shows
real content and the roadmap reflects what''s already there. This is the ONE
legitimate file→DB direction; after it the DB owns content and the flow is
DB→flat only — re-importing = drift. `<self>` = your shell_id.

## 1. List what exists — from the map, not a blind walk
```sql
-- the map is its own db: sc map-sql "<query>"
SELECT path, lang, lines FROM dr_filepath WHERE role=''doc'' ORDER BY path;
```
These are the repo''s real docs (README, `docs/`, `specs/`, guides). NEVER
ingest `_sc` dirs — those are OUR render output.

## 2. Read + classify, with the FnB
Read each doc; decide together:
- **spec** = describes a feature / planned work -> tie to a roadmap feature.
- **doc** = reference / guide / overview (README, CONTRIBUTING) -> general, no
  feature.
Skip noise (changelogs, license, vendored docs) unless the FnB wants it.

All writes below go through `sc mem` to durable shared control-plane state; the
import never touches the app DB.

## 3. Backfill the roadmap
Create one feature per coherent area/initiative the docs imply; status by how
built it is: `shipped` = done + documented, `near_term`/`brainstorm` = planned.
```
sc mem roadmap add "…" --status shipped --summary "…"
```

## 4. Ingest into `documents` (DB owns the body)
`--body-file` reads the real file straight into the body — no pasting:
```
# general doc (no feature):
sc mem doc add "README" --kind doc --body-file ./README.md --render-path docs_sc/readme.md
# a feature''s spec (link it):
sc mem doc add "…" --kind spec --feature <id> --body-file ./path/to/spec.md --render-path specs_sc/….md
```
Spec describes shipped work -> freeze it: `sc mem doc freeze <document_id>`.

## 5. Persist
Each confirmed `sc mem` write is live in the shared control plane immediately -> the GUI''s
Docs/Roadmap tabs reflect the import as you go. Flat `_sc` copies + git commit
= an admin/GUI publish step, not part of onboarding.

## 6. The host''s original files — three exits (optional; coexist by default)
The DB now holds the canonical copy; renders go to `_sc/`, so originals never
collide. Offer the FnB:
- **freeze** — leave the original files as-is (default).
- **archive** — move them to an abandoned branch, drop from `main`.
- **delete** — remove them (the DB has them).

edit the flat files or re-import them.',

1. **Find the image**

     earlier drops land there.

   - **What I see:** literal description — layout, labels, UI elements,
     annotations, the markup itself.
   - **What I understand:** interpreted intent — the change or requirement the

   - **What I propose:** concrete implementation plan — files, components,
     approach.

4. **Hold** — write/execute NO code until the FnB explicitly approves the

  '# self_update — laying a new floor under your own feet

The local shell updates its own substrate — no external rebuild. All state lives
in the DB and engine code is read live each session, so a code-only update
touches no data; a schema change applies as an in-place migration, never a
destructive rebuild. `current_state`, narrative, decisions, flags, seed, and
L&S all carry across. This is succession for the substrate: you handing off to
you.

## When

- An engine update is available and you choose the moment — no external race.
- The running prompt + schema were read at the old boot -> reboot after the
  update; they refresh only on the far side.

## Procedure

1. **Clean tree first.** `git -C <repo> status` -> clean. Commit, PR, or
   discard any prior update''s output BEFORE running again — a fresh `sc update`
   on top of a stranded one stacks two engine bumps into one diff. Glance at
   `current_state` + make it true for now (the snapshot captures it).

2. **Run.** `sc update` — fetches the Subfloor engine from its upstream remote
   (named `super-coder` in existing forks),
   materializes it into the gitignored `.super-coder/` dir (engine = dependency,
   not fork source), pins the new upstream SHA in `.sc-state/engine.ref`
   (prior saved as `engine.ref.prev`), backs up the live DB, applies pending
   migrations in place, syncs the skills catalogue, re-grants common skills,
   maps the repo, re-snapshots the live state.
   - `sc update --no-fetch` = reconcile against the current working tree
     (offline / dev); engine + `engine.ref` unchanged.
   - Missing-remote error -> `git remote add super-coder <subfloor-url>`.

3. **Verify.** `sc verify` — headless boot proof: shells, memory, granted
   skills intact + schema current. Wrong count -> `sc rollback` (below).
   - Then `sc render && sc render-check` before step 5. `sc update` re-renders
     from the live DB, which can skip a change the new engine shipped (e.g. a
     skill body) — only `render-check`''s hermetic rebuild surfaces it. A red
     render-check here = a local mirror to regenerate. Pipeline + guard details:
     `snapshot` skill.

4. **Record the crossing.** Append a narrative entry — identity event for a
   shell that updates its own floor. Note what changed + write the handoff.

5. **Commit only the public update.**
   Stage `.sc-state/engine.ref` (the pin), the root `sc` dispatcher if it
   changed, and other deliberately authored public files. Snapshot SQL and
   `_sc` renders remain ignored beneath `.sc-state/local/`; never force-add
   them. `.super-coder/` and `engine.ref.prev` are also gitignored in forks.

6. **Reboot** the session -> boot onto the new floor.

## Rolling back a bad update

`sc rollback` = sound pair-restore. Engine code is read live and a migration
exists because new code expects the new schema — restoring only the DB strands
new code on the old schema, so rollback restores both:

1. backs up the current (post-bad-update) DB first — rollback is itself
   reversible;
2. restores the DB from the most recent pre-update backup in
   `~/db_backups/<repo-name>/` (keyed by this fork''s repo dir name — distinct
   from any `db_backups/` dir the fork''s app keeps at its repo root);
3. re-materializes the engine at `.sc-state/engine.ref.prev` + restores
   `engine.ref`.

Whole-restore, not per-step schema reversal. Only data written between update
and rollback is lost (seconds, in practice). Reboot afterwards; commit the
restored `.sc-state/` if the rolled-back floor should persist.

## The contract you rely on

Every schema change AFTER a fork exists ships as a migration file
(`migrations/NNNN_*.sql`), never an edit to `schema.sql` — a baseline edit
reaches fresh clones but never an existing fork; the migration ledger carries
the delta. Authoring engine changes: structural change -> new migration file,
additive where possible.',

  '# snapshot — serialize the DB back to text

Live `shell_db.db` = the single source of truth shared by every shell; a
`sc mem` write is durable + visible to all shells the instant it commits. The
`.db` is gitignored and reconstructs from schema, migrations, and
`.sc-state/local/content.sql` on `sc rebuild` —
an edit not yet serialized is discarded by a rebuild.

Serializing is an admin/GUI operation, NOT a per-write shell step: it writes
the shared instance''s gitignored local cache. `sc snapshot` and `sc render`
run from the main checkout; the dispatcher refuses them from a linked shell
worktree. The GUI **Save locally** button, `install`, `update`, and
`render-check` run them for you. A working shell does not run them; its writes
are captured when admin saves locally before a rebuild. The rest of this skill
= the admin/GUI path.

## The three text serializations

| File(s) | What | Propagates? | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schema.sql` | the v1 baseline schema | yes (forks) | hand, rarely |
| `migrations/*.sql` | ordered schema + **system content** deltas (e.g. the skills catalogue) | yes (forks) | author / `sc seed-skills` |
| `.sc-state/local/content.sql` | **this repo''s** per-instance content + memory — shells, seed/L&S, decisions, roadmap, documents, flags, projects, skill grants | no (instance-only, gitignored) | `sc snapshot` |

The split: system content propagates via migrations; per-instance content stays
in the snapshot. Skill *bodies* = system (migration); which shell is *granted*
a skill = per-instance (snapshot).

Generated artifacts always live beneath `.sc-state/local/`. A legacy
`artifact_mode: tracked` setting is accepted only as upgrade input and resolves
to local; mode switching and Git publication are retired.

## When admin serializes

All commands run from the main checkout.

1. `sc snapshot` -> dumps the per-instance tables to the active
   local snapshot path. Deterministic DELETE-then-INSERT in PK order makes
   re-running byte-identical.

2. `sc render` -> regenerates the flat `_sc` files
   (`renders/specs_sc/`, `renders/docs_sc/`, `renders/skills_sc/`,
   `renders/roadmap_sc.md`) beneath `.sc-state/local/`. Run
   after changing a document body, the roadmap, or skills. Incremental —
   unchanged files not rewritten. (`.claude/skills/` rebuilds at boot and is
   gitignored — not rendered here.)

3. Verify reproducibility: `sc rebuild && sc verify` -> DB rebuilds from local text
   alone, byte-for-byte.
   `sc render-check` rebuilds the DB hermetically from text and fails if the
   local mirror drifts from that render. A plain `sc render` reads the *live* DB,
   which can lag the source just edited (skill-catalogue trap below);
   `render-check`''s rebuild-first catches the stale mirror the live-DB render
   silently passed.

4. Do not stage the output. Generated snapshots and renders are gitignored.
   Only authored engine source and explicit migrations belong in Git.

## Authoring vs. snapshotting

- **Per-instance content** (your memory, this repo''s roadmap/docs): edit the
  DB -> `sc snapshot`. The local DB is primary; the ignored snapshot is its
  rebuild source.
- **Skill catalogue** (system, propagates): edit
  `assets/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` -> `sc seed-skills` — upserts the live DB
  *and* (source repo only) regenerates the seed migration. Not the snapshot.
  See `seed_skills.py`.
  - Sequence: `sc seed-skills && sc render`, then `sc render-check`. Commit the
    regenerated `migrations/0001_seed_skills.sql`; the mirror stays ignored.

Steps 1–3 are the local durability path. There is no generated-artifact
publication path.

## Related skills

This skill owns the render/snapshot pipeline + the `render-check` guard:

- `fork_skill_design` — DB-canonical fork-local skills persist via the local
  snapshot.
- `engine_migrations` — a **content-seed** migration (skills, flavor defaults)
  changes what renders; rebuild + render + `render-check` after.

Load `sprint_protocol` first; it holds the lifecycle, wake types, inbox
commands, relay contract, body limits, artifact paths, receipt recovery, and
authority boundary. This skill holds only the Developer''s steps.

## Route the entry

| Trigger | First read / action |
|---|---|
| Assignment, verdict, question, blocker, relay | Inspect `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once; accept or handle the relevant message. Accepted assignment -> `sc context --work-unit <id>` next. |
| Self-describing engine-wide PR fact | Inspect the fact + registered PR directly. Do not manufacture a Sprint inbox item; check the inbox once immediately before the next typed handoff. |
| Live FnB instruction | Preserve its authority; read only durable state needed for safe action. |

## Bound the lane

`sc context --work-unit <id>` is the default planning context: assignment,
expected output, linked tasks, bound revision id, active decisions,
dependencies, unit blockers, roles, worktree, lifecycle walls, resources. Read
the full bound revision or broader indexes only for an unresolved need. Own
one active unit; never start another lane or edit another shell''s worktree.
Resolve ambiguity to shippable in-scope work + rationale. Ask the Planner
before changing boundary, interface, deliverable, priority, or scope; ask the
Reviewer about review evidence. Use the relay''s unit question/blocker form and
stop at a decision boundary until the answer arrives.

A Developer does not pause the Sprint. Report blocker or integrity evidence to
the Planner, continue safe independent work, and stop at the unsafe boundary.
The Reviewer decides continue/replan/pause; the Planner executes the decision.

## Build and verify

Sync + branch; implement the smallest complete change. Per your TESTING
POSTURE, finish code + run every available smallest affected gate. If the
selected interpreter, runner, or declared dependency cannot execute one,
record exact seat evidence; the registered PR supplies only that proof. Test
assertion/source collection red or incomplete code = failure. Optional browser
skip = non-failing. Keep external calls outside DB transactions; preserve
durable identities and append-only evidence. Record failures, anomalies,
retries, review friction, and departures for closeout.

Immediately before `complete-unit`, `register-pr`, or `request-review`, re-run
`sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once and act on new messages. After the typed
handoff confirms its durable write, stop without another inbox pass. The
reopened-PR route below is the sole exception.

## Report-only or no-code completion

Only an explicitly planned report/no-code lane may finish without a PR. Keep
the result near 6,000 characters and below 8,000; run `wc -m < <path>`, perform
the pre-handoff inbox check, then require a durable completion receipt:

```text
sc sprint complete-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> \
  --result-file <path>
```

Stop after success. A code lane continues through merge observation.

## Register and observe the PR

```text
sc sprint register-pr --sprint <id> --repository <owner/name> \
  --pr <number> --work-unit <id>
```

Register complete code even when a local gate is unavailable; registration
obtains evidence, not review. After `register-pr` succeeds, retain ownership;
red/green/closed/merged wakes continue (the engine may already have discovered
the PR from your worktree branch; `register-pr` attaches it). Required checks:
pending -> native wake; red -> fix/push; green -> judge/request review; none or
untrustworthy watcher after one bounded read -> report + block. Follow
context: armed -> fix red + judge/pass green + merged -> post-merge handoff;
paused -> fix red now + judge green, review after resume; no active Sprint ->
fix red if needed, green arrives only as red recovery, merged -> git skill
after-merge cleanup. Planner/Reviewer get none.

If the same registered PR was externally closed, then reopened, rebased, and
pushed, replay the exact `register-pr` command. Require `created: false`, which
keeps identity/ownership and takes a fresh snapshot. Its one pre-handoff inbox
check covers registration replay + the immediately following review request.
Do not wait for a second PR-fact wake: immediately request review. Green
proceeds; any other snapshot returns the watcher diagnostic without partial
handoff. Never register a replacement PR or ask the Planner to bypass observed
green.

Otherwise, when no local action remains, stop for the native PR fact. A stalled
gate permits one bounded read, then stop or report its evidence:

```text
sc sprint watcher-state --sprint <id>
```

Do not repeat this read as a polling loop.

## Review handoff and correction

Complete each round in order:

1. Finish readiness judgment + available local proof; require observed green.
2. Perform the once-only inbox check; handle and `accept` new messages.
3. Use `submit` first or `resubmit` after changes requested. The engine injects
   the PR URL, registered id, exact green head, and work-unit id into the
   Reviewer''s canonical bare one-line locator. Create no readiness file. Send
   no scope narrative, verification evidence, rationale, or review-focus
   steering in the request. The PR body carries the work-unit id and spec
   reference plus your rationale (decisions, rejected trade-offs): each verdict
   opens a fresh chat with only GitHub to read. Write no PR comments or
   annotations.
4. As the literal final action, run:

```text
sc sprint request-review \
  --sprint <id> --registered-pr <registered-id> \
  --intent <submit|resubmit> --key <stable-key>
```

5. Require confirmation of the durable write + Reviewer wake; run no trailing
   command and stop and await the native verdict wake.

Changes requested arrives as a fresh chat: orient from the PR body, diff, and
verdict; do not re-litigate choices the rationale explains. Apply every
blocking finding, re-establish green, and resubmit with a new review-round key.
Do not narrate cleared findings; the Reviewer verifies the full diff. Record
disagreements as judgment. Reviewer owns scope/severity; Planner executes
resulting action.

## Merge boundary

Immediately before merge, re-read live GitHub, grant, ownership, unit state,
and checks through:

```text
sc sprint authorize-merge \
  --sprint <id> --registered-pr <registered-id>
```

Merge only the returned repository, PR, and head SHA. A refusal means not
green, not approved, or not yours; fix that, never bypass it. A rebase does not
undo approval. The FnB granted this merge by arming the Sprint; this command
verifies that grant live and is the only gate — never wait for a separate FnB
directive, and never merge on approval or green alone.

## Post-merge handoff

After the authorized merge:

1. Clean the worktree; put merged PR + SHA, unit result, verification,
   judgments, and departures in the handoff file.
2. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once; handle and `accept` new items.
3. Run `wc -m < <path>`; keep the body near 6,000 characters and below 8,000.
4. As the literal final action, send:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <planner-shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent handoff --key <stable-merged-handoff-key>
```

5. Require the durable message + Planner wake, then stop immediately. Run no
   trailing Git, Sprint, inbox, cleanup, or status command. Automatic merge
   observation records the PR transition; this handoff releases the next wave.

## Report and stop

Report broken bases, destructive ambiguity, unavailable GitHub, untrustworthy
runners, provider exhaustion, or unrecoverable environment with evidence,
impact, and recommendation. Stop when merged + reported, declined, returned to
review, paused for a native wake, or awaiting Planner/FnB recovery. Ask for
later work only after this editing lane is terminal.',

Load `sprint_protocol` first; it holds the lifecycle, wake types, inbox
commands, relay contract, body limits, artifact paths, receipt recovery, and
authority boundary. This skill holds only the Planner''s steps after
`sprint_prep` arms the Sprint.

## What you can read

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| Whole Sprint: lifecycle, participants with current routes, units, dependencies, PRs, health | `sc sprint show --sprint <id>` |
| Messages addressed to you | `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` |
| Exact bound spec body | `sc sprint spec-revision --sprint <id> --document <id> [--body-only]` |
| PR-watcher evidence behind a stalled gate | `sc sprint watcher-state --sprint <id>` |
| Post-Sprint cleanup evidence | `sc sprint cleanup-status --sprint <id>` |
| Bounded history packet: judgments, pauses, anomalies, follow-ups | `sc sprint compile-report --sprint <id> --limit 50` |
| Candidate routes and what each supports | `sc models list [<harness>]`; preview one with `sc models resolve <harness> [<model>] [--effort <level>]` |
| Shell roster, feature, spec tasks, settled decisions | `sc mem get shells`, `sc mem get roadmap`, `sc mem get tasks --feature <id>`, `sc mem get decisions` |

`show` participants carry `shell_id`, `role`, `harness`, `model`, `effort`,
`binding_status`, and `route_revision`; units carry `developer`, `reviewer`,
`disposition`, `prerequisite_ids`, and `pull_requests`. A Thinking level
applies only to controlled routes: `null` model + `null` effort is Harness
default, and Vibe takes no effort.

## Route the entry

| Trigger | Route |
|---|---|
| Sprint decision, merged-work handoff, question, blocker, relay | Inspect `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once; handle that message. |
| Engine-wide completion or cleanup receipt | Inspect receipt + terminal state directly; it is informational — do not run the Sprint inbox, accept it, or close again. |
| Live FnB instruction | Act under board override; name FnB authority in durable evidence. |

You receive no PR-event wakes; red/green/closed/merged facts go to Developers.

## Durable running loop

Read only trigger-required lifecycle, unit, dependency, route, PR, expectation,
and anomaly facts. Browser presence is not progress.

```text
sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>
```

Dispatch every dependency-ready lane; returned ids are wake identities.
Disposition + messages are release facts. Stable assignment generations and
occupied lanes make dispatch repeat-safe.

- Keep dependencies as hard sequence; restructure current projection under
  Planner authority, record why, and never rewrite completed history.
- Developers own local/PR proof, review/fix/merge. Complete code + unavailable
  local gate -> registered CI: pending wait, red fix, green review; browser skip
  is non-failing. With fallback, Planner NEVER mutates packages/toolchains or
  runs repair. No checks/untrustworthy watcher after one read -> blocker.
  Reviewers own verdicts/conformance; do not proxy handoffs/judgments.
- Record Reviewer decision id + exact action + receipt; never rewrite rationale
  as Planner judgment.
- Reviewer-approved Planner/FnB spec rebind:
  pause -> `sc mem doc edit` -> `sc sprint rebind-spec --sprint <id>
  --document <id> --expected-revision <old-sha256> --reason <decision>` ->
  replan -> resume. Pass = old/new hashes + changed boolean; conflict -> reread.
- Relay Developer integrity evidence, impact, and recommendation to the
  Reviewer. Send required context before pausing: paused Sprint relay is
  unavailable.

## Reviewer decisions and Planner actions

For a required-reply Reviewer decision, keep this order:

1. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`; verify the assigned Reviewer + retain the id.
2. Send a linked acknowledgement (`--intent information --reply-to <decision-message-id>`).
3. Require the reply command to confirm its durable message and wake; retry the
   same command/key if ambiguous.
4. `sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <decision-message-id>`.
5. Only after acceptance, execute the requested transition without
   re-adjudicating it. The linked reply must precede any pause or abort that
   makes the relay unavailable.

Record decision id + reply, acceptance, and action receipts. Clean conformance
closes atomically and sends an informational receipt; no reply/accept is
needed. If an action fails a lifecycle/authority/disposition precondition,
send the refusal + durable state to the Reviewer (or FnB for an override),
substitute nothing, and stop.

### Pause or resume

Pause for a Reviewer decision or safe Planner restructuring; preserve partial
artifacts, interrupt intent, judgment, and evidence:

```text
sc sprint pause --sprint <id> --reason <decision-or-restructure-reason>
```

Resume only after recording recovery/restructure and reconciling native runs,
unread messages, wakes, units, PRs, capacity, and spec drift:

```text
sc sprint resume --sprint <id> [--reason <validated-reconciliation-reason>]
```

Preserve the current conformance owner on ordinary resume. Replace that owner
only while paused, only with an eligible participating Reviewer, and always
record a reason:

```text
sc sprint resume --sprint <id> \
  --conformance-reviewer-shell <replacement-shell-id> \
  --reason <ownership-replacement-reason>
```

Require the receipt and board projection to show the replacement owner and a
new ownership generation before treating the Sprint as resumed. An exhausted
recovery wake = bounded manual evidence: preserve the unread message + failed
wake, involve FnB, create no recursive fallback. Drift informs but never
silently blocks resume.

Aborted-Sprint PR ownership repair belongs to the originating Planner. Keep
the replacement Sprint paused; establish old/new identity, then:

```text
sc sprint reconcile-pr --sprint <replacement-id> --repository <owner/repo> \
  --pr <number> --work-unit <replacement-unit-id> --reason <recovery-reason>
```

It refuses a live source or target Sprint, a non-originating Planner, an
invalid/owned target, and a closed-unmerged PR. Require a separate Reviewer
decision before resuming.

### Modify, recall, repeat, reassign, or reroute

Cancel unreleased scope with retained terminal reason/Reviewer id:

```text
sc sprint cancel-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> --reason <reason>
```

Edit an unreleased lane; omitted fields stay, `--clear-dependencies` means none:

```text
sc sprint replan-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> \
  [--developer-shell <id>] [--reviewer-shell <id>] [--title <title>] \
  [--expected-output-file <path>] [--task <task-id>] [--wave <n>] \
  [--depends-on <work-unit-id> | --clear-dependencies] \
  [--output-kind code|report-only|no-code]
```

Never edit a released lane in place. Pause -> recall the unmerged lane
(`sc sprint recall-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> --reason <reason>`) ->
replan -> resume. Recall preserves message/event history, returns only
unmerged work to planned, and refuses terminal/PR-bound work. PR-bound work
stays; plan replacement or use reconciliation. Resume creates a fresh
assignment generation. One spec task may govern repeated verification or
replacement lanes; each lane lists it once — do not duplicate the spec task.

Close a released lane terminal when its work finished out-of-band (a PR that
merged while paused) or its lane is abandoned — the PR-bound case recall
refuses:

```text
sc sprint resolve-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> \
  --to completed|cancelled --reason <reason>
```

Paused-only; retires the lane''s open expectations, supersedes its PR links
(registration kept for reconcile-pr), and wakes both seats.

To change a future assignment or review route, pause the armed Sprint, take
each participant''s `shell_id` and current route from `sc sprint show`, preview
the replacement with `sc models resolve`, then replace the route and resume:

```text
sc sprint reroute-participant --sprint <id> --participant-shell <id> \
  --harness <harness> [--model <model>] [--effort <effort>] \
  [--route <display-route>]
```

Prepared Sprints may reroute directly. Reroute declared participants only. On
a decline, preserve the reason and choose a replacement from current capacity;
ask the Reviewer only if review/conformance judgment changes.

### Re-enter after conformance

The Reviewer decision names findings; governing tasks (existing for the same
scope, new title/description for new scope); and grouping, waves,
dependencies, routing, capacity. Preserve it; do not absorb extra or
post-Sprint scope or maximize occupancy.

```text
sc mem task add "<task-title>" --feature <feature-id> \
  --doc <governing-spec-document-id> --seq <next-seq> \
  --desc "<task-description>"

sc sprint plan-unit --sprint <id> \
  --developer-shell <id> --reviewer-shell <id> --title <title> \
  --expected-output-file <path> --task <task-id> \
  [--task <task-id>] [--wave <n>] [--depends-on <work-unit-id>] \
  [--output-kind code|report-only|no-code]
```

Reuse a task for exact repair/repeat; add only genuinely new scope. Bind every
task, then confirm routes, dependency graph, and capacity plan match the
decision. Release ready lanes with `sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>`. The
engine sends the next delivery-terminal wake; you do not initiate conformance.

### Conclude or abort

Clean `record-conformance` by the Reviewer atomically stores conformance,
follow-ups, the Reviewer-authored final report, completion, and your
informational receipt. On it, verify Sprint/reports/outcome/completed state.
Do not run `complete`; do not author a second report; do not manually close
peer chats.

The initial completion receipt reports `cleanup_state=pending`: delivery is
finished, but managed worktrees are not reusable yet. Stop for the engine-wide
cleanup receipt; do not poll or manually reset participant trees. On
`cleanup_state=succeeded`, treat the slots as reusable. On failure, inspect
once and retry only after correcting the named condition:

```text
sc sprint cleanup-status --sprint <id>
sc sprint cleanup --sprint <id> --key <stable-retry-key>
```

Require `created`, cleanup request id, action, exact target ids, and aggregate
projection. Reuse the key only for the same request. Abort only on a Reviewer
decision or FnB override; it is terminal and deletes nothing:

```text
sc sprint abort --sprint <id> --reason <reason> [--outcome <outcome>]
```

## Handoffs and stop

Never dispatch the next wave from merge observation. The merged-work handoff
wake is the only normal next-wave dispatch trigger. On it:

1. Run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`; inspect the merged handoff + unit/dependency state.
2. Handle earlier informational items and `accept` each, including the handoff.
3. Finish reconciliation and Planner bookkeeping; no work remains.
4. As the literal final action run `sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>`.
5. Require durable assignments + wakes, then stop. Run no trailing command.
   Empty dispatch remains final; investigate only on a later durable wake.

On an initial clean completion receipt, verify the named Sprint is terminal and
record `cleanup_state=pending`; run no close command. Stop until the
engine-authored cleanup success or failure receipt arrives.',

  '# sprint_prep — declare the riverbed

Load `sprint_protocol` first. Use this as the owning Planner while a Sprint is
`prepared`. Preparation ends at one atomic arming decision; it does not launch
participants piecemeal.

## Outcome

Produce one editable prepared Sprint with:

- one roadmap feature;
- exact governing spec revision hashes and any optional QA/QC evidence;
- work units made from existing spec tasks, each with one Developer and one
  assigned Reviewer;
- dependency edges and planned waves;
- one harness/model/Thinking level (`effort`) intent per participant;
- the Sprint merge grant — the FnB''s merge authorization for every registered
  Sprint PR, given by deciding to run the Sprint and recorded with
  `--merge-grant`; the engine refuses to declare or arm without it; and
- a capacity plan sized to justified parallel work and review demand, with the
  local/GitHub capacity to execute it.

Preview every participant with
`sc models resolve <harness> [<model>] [--effort <level>]`; omit `--effort` for
Vibe and Harness default. Pass = each controlled preview names the requested
Thinking level and each uncontrolled preview returns explicit `effort: null`.
Arm binds every route, records the armed transition, and publishes the first
assignments in one transaction; any mismatch rolls the whole arm back.

## Eligibility pass

Read the feature, selected spec bodies, task ledgers, available QA/QC records,
shell roster, model routes, quota state, repository access, and worktree
availability. Record the exact revision hash you inspected; a title or document
id is not a revision.

The FnB decides whether pre-Sprint QA/QC is useful. If requested, ask the
Review shell through ordinary inbox mail (no Sprint relay exists yet); it
signs the current exact body with:

```text
sc mem doc qaqc <spec-document-id> --verdict pass|fail [--findings-doc <document-id>]
```

The record is inspectable evidence, not launch authorization. Its absence,
verdict, findings, revision age, or signer state never blocks declaration or
arming. A body edit makes the prior record historical evidence. Proceed with
preparation regardless of whether review was performed or what it found.

Refuse arming when any of these is true:

- no current non-empty `spec` document belonging to the feature is bound;
- a bound spec body changed after declaration, so its current hash no longer
  matches the exact declared revision;
- a selected task belongs to no work unit or more than one work unit;
- a dependency cycle exists;
- a work unit lacks an assigned Developer or Reviewer;
- participant routes or required capacity are unavailable;
- a selected shell has an unresolved cleanup target from an earlier Sprint;
- another Sprint is armed, or a selected shell already participates in an armed
  Sprint.

Deficiencies remain editable in `prepared`. Do not weaken an invariant merely
to get to `armed`; surface the missing fact or capacity to the FnB.

## Shape work, do not script behavior

A work unit is one coherent editing lane and may group related spec tasks. Use
dependencies only for hard prerequisites. Waves express intent and later report
comparison; they do not forbid safe out-of-order completion. Reviews are not
editing lanes.

Prefer the smallest dependency graph that preserves correctness. Record the
expected output in outcome language. Do not encode a shell''s implementation
steps into the durable plan when its role skill and judgment can decide them.

### Balance capacity and parallelism

Optimize for the smallest participant set that keeps justified critical-path
development and review moving without avoidable queues. Neither minimum
headcount nor maximum shell occupancy is a goal.

Before choosing participants, analyze the task ledger and dependency graph for
coherent non-overlapping editing lanes, expected readiness, critical-path work,
and likely review demand. Put dependency-free Developer lanes in the same wave
and plan Reviewer capacity so ready reviews can run alongside ongoing
independent development. Do not serialize work merely because it appears in
task order, split coherent work, or start a review before its unit is ready just
to create concurrency.

- For one coherent small lane, normally use one Developer and one Reviewer.
- Add a Developer only when another independent lane can start or make useful
  progress without conflicting ownership and has enough review capacity.
- Add Reviewer capacity when expected concurrent review demand would otherwise
  queue critical-path work. Reuse a Reviewer across units when their review
  readiness is unlikely to overlap.
- Leave eligible capacity unassigned when the roster allows, preserving room
  for correction, re-plan, or urgent work. Use every eligible shell only when
  the work graph and review demand justify simultaneous work and coordination
  cost does not erase the expected time-to-completion gain.

Record the capacity rationale: chosen participants, parallel lanes, expected
review overlap, retained reserve, and why another shell would or would not
shorten the critical path.

For every participant, record role, route, nullable model, and Thinking level
(`effort`). Controlled exact routes default omitted effort to `high` only when
the preview proves support. Set both model and effort to JSON null for Harness
default. Vibe requires effort null and reports **Thinking control unavailable**.
Never pretend a native session can resume across harnesses.

Declare the prepared envelope from a JSON array of participant objects, binding
each current governing document directly. The server reads and hashes the body
inside the declaration transaction; the client never supplies a revision hash.
Then add each editing lane from existing spec tasks:

```text
sc sprint declare --feature <feature-id> \
  --spec <spec-document-id> --participants-file <path> --merge-grant
sc sprint plan-unit --sprint <id> \
  --developer-shell <id> --reviewer-shell <id> --title <title> \
  --expected-output-file <path> --task <task-id> \
  [--task <task-id>] [--wave <n>] [--depends-on <work-unit-id>] \
  [--output-kind code|report-only|no-code]
```

Repeat `--spec` for multiple governing documents. The deprecated
`--spec-approval <approval-id>` selector remains compatible when an old caller
must also retain a specific review row as evidence, but its verdict and reviewed
revision do not affect eligibility and direct `--spec` is canonical.

The participant file contains `shell_id`, `role`, and `harness`, with optional
nullable `model`, Thinking level (`effort`), and `route`. FnB may add
`--planner-shell <id>` when declaring for the originating Planner. Keep the
Sprint prepared while shaping the plan.

## Final arming check

Immediately before arming, select exactly one participating Reviewer as the
whole-Sprint conformance owner. Then re-read the exact spec revision hashes,
available QA/QC evidence, task coverage, participant routes and capacity,
single-armed invariant, repository access, prior-Sprint cleanup state, and
merge grant. Review evidence is summarized, never interpreted as authorization.

If arming reports an unresolved cleanup target, inspect it once and act on its
named recovery instead of manually changing that worktree:

```text
sc sprint cleanup-status --sprint <prior-sprint-id>
sc sprint cleanup --sprint <prior-sprint-id> --key <stable-retry-key>
```

Only the originating Planner or FnB retries a failed scheduled cleanup. Only
FnB may add `--adopt-legacy` for one completed Sprint that predates scheduling.

```text
sc sprint arm --sprint <id> --conformance-reviewer-shell <shell-id>
```

Require the receipt to identify the selected owner and one revision-1 binding
for every participant. After `arm` succeeds, participant pickup belongs to
native delivery: the armed runtime dispatches ready work and wake recovery
reconciles unread pickup. Do not boot participants or create a second wake
path.

## Handoff

Once armed, hand control to `sprint_pln` and stop preparation work. Give the FnB
a compact declaration: Sprint id, feature, exact spec revisions,
participants/routes, work-unit graph, planned waves, capacity rationale and
reserve, merge-grant state, and known accepted risks. State whether pre-Sprint
QA/QC was performed and summarize any available evidence without treating it
as an eligibility result.

Stop when the Sprint is armed or when one concrete eligibility blocker has been
surfaced. Do not dispatch from a partially prepared plan.',

durable state supports; treat authority, lifecycle preconditions, durable
writes, and typed handoffs as hard boundaries and use judgment inside them.
Repeat a read only when later activity could have changed it or the next
command requires live revalidation.

## Lifecycle

One Sprint binds one roadmap feature, exact governing spec revisions, a
participant set (one Planner, Developers, Reviewers) each on one
harness/model/effort route, and work units: editing lanes of spec tasks, each
with one Developer and one Reviewer, ordered by dependencies and waves.
`prepared` (editable) -> `armed` (ready lanes dispatch to Developers) <->
`paused` (relay off; restructure and reroute here) -> `completed` or `aborted`
(terminal; nothing deleted). One Sprint is armed at a time. A lane: dispatched
-> Developer builds, registers the PR, requests review -> Reviewer records a
verdict -> Developer merges under the Sprint grant once `authorize-merge`
returns live green + approved -> the merged handoff wakes the Planner, who
dispatches what became ready. After the last lane the conformance Reviewer
records the whole-Sprint report; the engine closes the Sprint and cleans
worktrees.

## Wake types

Three literals name how a Sprint message reaches you:

| Type | Delivery |
|---|---|
| `new` | a fresh chat when the shell has none or its chat is idle; absorbed at the boundary of a live turn |
| `force-new` | never absorbed; waits for the live turn to end and a quiet gate, then closes the old chat and opens a fresh one |
| `re-enter` | resumes the existing chat at its next boundary |

Assignments, review requests, and verdicts arrive `force-new`; Planner-bound
results, decisions, and PR facts arrive `re-enter`. You never choose a type,
poll, boot a participant, or schedule a watcher; the engine delivers. Stop
after a successful typed handoff and wait for the next wake.

## Inbox, accept, decline

```text
sc sprint show --sprint <id>
sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>
sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <message-id>
sc sprint decline --sprint <id> --message <message-id> --reason <reason>
```

Inspect the inbox once per trigger. Accepting an assignment starts ownership;
decline only with a concrete reason. After an informational message, `accept`
marks it read and changes no Sprint or work-unit state. Re-run the inbox once
immediately before each typed handoff and act on new items; after the handoff
confirms its durable write, stop without another pass.

## Relay

Every message is one short body file. Unit question or blocker (requires a
reply):

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent question|blocker --requires-reply --work-unit <work-unit-id> \
  --key <stable-key>
```

Cross-unit, closeout, or external-authority rulings are Sprint-level:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent decision --requires-reply --sprint-level --key <stable-key>
```

Reply through the original message; the reply inherits its scope, so never add
`--work-unit` or `--sprint-level` to a reply:

```text
sc sprint send --sprint <id> --to <shortname> --body-file <path> \
  --intent information --reply-to <message-id> --key <stable-key>
```

Confirm the durable reply, then `accept` the incoming message. At a decision
boundary, stop until the required answer arrives; unread recovery re-wakes the
recipient, so send no duplicate reminder.

**Stable key** = recipient + exact body + intent + reply target + scope. Reuse
it only to retry the same failed or ambiguous write; when any field changes,
use a new key. **Body size**: near 6,000 characters and below 8,000 — run
`wc -m < <path>` before sending. A handoff is complete only when the command
exits successfully and confirms the durable write and wake. Rejected or
transport-failed -> correct and retry. Relay itself unavailable -> give the FnB
the attempted command, evidence, impact, and recommendation; invent no
alternate protocol.

## Receipt recovery

An unusable success receipt from idempotent bookkeeping does not stall the
Sprint: retry the exact command once, then use its normal read surface once to
prove the postcondition (for an informational `accept`: the message was in the
inbox and is now absent). Continue under that proof and name the receipt
defect in your next handoff. Never use this to infer assignment ownership,
review outcome, merge authorization, a lifecycle or work-unit transition, the
governing revision, PR head or green state, or cleanup authority; an unproved
postcondition stops.

## Artifacts

Working material — review notes, raw diffs, evidence packets, report drafts,
scratch proof — goes under the gitignored `shared/sprints/sprint-<n>/`; never
commit, branch, or PR it (a review-notes commit is a finding). Durable records
are DB rows: judgments via `record-review`, reports via `record-conformance`,
decisions in the relay.

## Authority

Reviewers own judgments: verdicts, conformance, re-enter and abort decisions.
The Planner owns plan structure — lanes, dependencies, waves, assignment,
routes, pause, resume, dispatch — and executes Reviewer decisions without
re-adjudicating them. A Developer owns one lane and its PR. The FnB may
override any of it from the GUI Sprints tab; name that authority in the
durable evidence when acting under it. A command that rejects a transition
returns the durable state to the deciding role; substitute nothing.',

  '# sprint_rev — independent review and conformance

Load `sprint_protocol` first; it holds the lifecycle, wake types, inbox
commands, relay contract, body limits, artifact paths, receipt recovery, and
authority boundary. This skill holds only the Reviewer''s steps: pre-declaration
QA/QC, one work-unit review, or whole-Sprint conformance.

## Route the entry

| Entry | Route |
|---|---|
| Explicit pre-declaration QA/QC request | Read and sign the exact current spec directly; there is no Sprint id or Sprint inbox yet. |
| Work-unit review / `sprint.delivery_terminal` | Inspect the Sprint inbox once; accept the actionable request. |
| Live FnB instruction | Preserve board-level authority; read only durable state needed for independent judgment. |

QA/QC precedes all Sprint inbox commands and is one write:

```text
sc mem doc qaqc <spec-document-id> --verdict pass|fail [--findings-doc <document-id>]
```

Reviewers never receive PR-event wakes.

## Conformance decisions and Planner controls

You own review, re-enter, abort, and conclude judgments. The Planner
independently owns operational plan structure: safe-edit pauses, recalling
unreleased work, lane changes/repeats, assignment/routing, unreleased-scope
cancellation, and validated resume. Never run standalone pause, replan,
recall, reroute, cancel, resume, complete, or abort actions; clean
`record-conformance` alone performs its narrow atomic close.

Base judgment on durable Sprint state, bound revisions, current work/PR facts,
progress-carrier evidence, and ratified judgments. A decision body names:

- `decision`: `re-enter`, `abort`, or the exact safety-critical recommendation;
- Reviewer-owned evidence + rationale;
- exact Sprint/unit ids, reason, outcome, and complete action arguments;
- immediate safety impact for FnB.

The Planner verifies your identity and executes the transition without
surrendering plan authority. A rejected action requires a revised judgment
supported by returned durable state, never an improvised bypass. A live FnB
instruction is the FnB''s board-level override.

## Severity rubric

- **Critical** — active security/authority violation, destructive corruption,
  or unsafe continued operation.
- **Major** — wrong behavior, data loss, broken invariant, material spec
  violation, or silently wedged delivery/recovery.
- **Medium** — concrete normal-use correctness/recovery gap, missing negative
  enforcement, or unreliable handoff.
- **Low** — bounded cleanup, clarity, test-depth, or resilience improvement;
  delivered behavior remains correct.

Critical/Major/Medium block unit approval; Low is a report note. At closeout,
severity does not decide timing: you judge whether each finding requires
in-Sprint patching or acceptable post-Sprint follow-up.

## Work-unit review

Accept the request and retain that exact message id. Its body is a bare
locator: intent, PR URL, registered PR id, exact head, work-unit id. Scope
narrative, verification, rationale, or focus steering is a protocol defect. PR
comments and annotations are forbidden; the PR body contains only unit id +
spec reference plus the Developer''s rationale.

Bind inspection/verdict to the accepted request''s message id, registered PR,
and work unit. Review the live PR head; a rebase since the locator''s head is
not a defect. Read the exact spec revision + full diff, then checks, tests,
relevant runtime facts, and ratified judgments. Each round is clean: no prior
Developer evidence or prose; prior findings clear only when the new head
proves it. Trace code paths, failure cases, and spec behavior rather than
names or PR prose.

### Red-check doctrine

Accepted-red is not a legal review outcome. A departure that leaves checks
failing is never acceptable; the handoff remains green-only, without exception
or waiver: do not note the failure and approve anyway.

- In-scope failure -> record `changes_requested` so the Developer fixes them and restores green.
- Out-of-scope failure -> keep the lane unapproved and send the Planner a `replan`
  decision naming the failures; Planner widens the lane or cuts follow-up work.

Read cited and feature-scoped resolved flag evidence through memory
(`sc mem get flags <flag-id>`, `sc mem get flags --feature <id> --resolved`).

Each finding pins severity/title, violated invariant, exact location/evidence,
reproducible consequence, and fix boundary without unnecessary architecture.

Complete a unit verdict in this exact order:

1. Finish every inspection, finding, and verdict body.
2. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once; handle + `accept` new items.
3. Run `wc -m < <path>`; require near 6,000 and below 8,000 characters.
4. As the literal final action, run:

```text
sc sprint record-review \
  --sprint <id> --registered-pr <registered-id> \
  --verdict changes_requested|approved --body-file <path> --key <stable-key>
```

5. Require durable judgment evidence + the Developer wake. Run no trailing
   command; stop.

Use `approved` only with no Critical/Major/Medium finding. Engine validation
requires the accepted request. Do not message around the surface; an
unrecorded verdict cannot unlock merge.

## Delivery-terminal closeout

Retain the exact notification message id + delivered wake as this closeout
episode''s identity. Proceed only when the notification names this shell as the
selected conformance owner for its current ownership generation. A different
Reviewer accepts the informational notification if received and records no
conformance. Inspect inbox, lifecycle, and units first:

- Already completed/aborted -> `accept` notification and stop.
- Any non-terminal unit visible -> the wake is stale: `accept`, stop, and
  await a fresh delivery-terminal episode.
- Only an armed Sprint whose units are all terminal enters conformance.

Compile the bounded evidence packet first, yourself:

```text
sc sprint compile-report --sprint <id> --limit 50 \
  > shared/sprints/sprint-<n>/evidence.json
```

Increase only when truncation omitted needed evidence; maximum 200. Judge
integrated `main` against every bound/current revision + ratified judgment. All
units cancelled and nothing shipped -> `abort`, not `conclude`.

Choose one branch:

- **In-Sprint patching required.** Do not run `record-conformance`. Send the
  Planner a durable `re-enter` decision with every blocking finding; each spec
  task''s title and description; grouping, waves, dependencies, routing, and
  capacity rationale. State independent lanes, expected review overlap, useful
  reserve, and critical-path effect. After three re-entry episodes, escalate
  non-convergence to FnB.
- **Clean or post-Sprint-only findings.** Prepare conformance report, findings,
  final report, reason, and outcome; submit the atomic close below. Send no
  conclude message.

## Whole-Sprint conformance

Review the integrated system, not unit diffs. Classify every requirement
`as-specced`, `deviated-intentionally` with ratified judgment,
`deviated-silently`, or `unimplemented`; the last two are findings. Include
spec document + work-unit ids when known.

For the clean branch, write a conformance report and JSON findings array with
`severity`, `title`, `body`, `spec_document_id`, and `work_unit_id`. Keep the
report and each body near 6,000 and below 8,000 characters; run
`wc -m < <report>` and validate each body.

Before recording conformance, author the final Sprint report. Name yourself as
author and cover governing scope/revisions, shipped units/PRs, judgments +
ratified deviations, failures/retries/recovery/anomalies, conclusion,
follow-ups, and evidence location. Keep it near 6,000 and below 8,000; preserve
discrepancies.

Record one atomic final write:

```text
sc sprint record-conformance \
  --sprint <id> --body-file <report> --findings-file <json> \
  --final-report-file <final-report> --reason <reason> --outcome <outcome> \
  --key <stable-pass-key>
```

Require the receipt: conformance report id, final report id, follow-up ids,
completed state, Planner message id, and Planner wake id. Require cleanup
projection `pending`; cleanup runs after participant turns exit. Do not reset a
worktree, poll cleanup, or wait before stopping. Do not manually close peer
chats. Never reopen editing after recording; a re-enter defers reports until
new scope is terminal and a fresh delivery-terminal wake arrives.

## Stop

Unit review ends with the ordered `record-review` write as the literal final
action.

For closeout, first re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`, handle + `accept`
new messages, then confirm every artifact/body is final and below 8,000.

- Clean conclude -> run the atomic `record-conformance` command above as the
  literal final action. When it confirms completed state, pending cleanup, and
  all receipt identities, stop immediately; the Planner is notified.
- Re-enter/abort -> as literal final action send the Sprint-level `decision`
  to the Planner (relay form in `sprint_protocol`), require durable write +
  Planner wake, then stop immediately. Run no trailing command until another
  native wake.',

  '# themed_markdown — the authoring format

A document `body` IS themed-markdown — the format md-converter renders. Your
job is structure; styling is the renderer''s. NEVER write visual instructions
(colors, fonts, sizes, themes) — apply the four semantic classes; the theme
picks colors. Use ONLY the constructs below; anything else drops silently or
breaks the render.

`req` = required · `opt` = optional · `≤N` = soft character cap (over-cap
wraps awkwardly / overflows a fixed UI slot).

## Frontmatter

```
---
title: Document Title
tags: [tag1, tag2]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
project: Project Name
purpose: Brief description
---
```

| Field | Status | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | req | ≤40 |
| `tags` | req (YAML list; `[]` ok) | — |
| `date` | opt | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `project` | opt | ≤40 |
| `purpose` | opt | ≤40 |

`date`/`project`/`purpose` -> footer meta cards. The render injects
`feature`, `roadmap_status`, `frozen`, `rendered_by`, `source` on top — NEVER
write those yourself. Tags = YAML list only; comma-separated (`tags: a, b`)
breaks.

## Structure

| Syntax | Role | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| `# Title` | doc title (opt; falls back to `frontmatter.title`) | — |
| `## Section` | sidebar tab | ≤28 |
| `### Heading` | subsection -> `<h3>` | ≤80 |

H4–H6 ⛔.

**Tab rule:** every H2 = one tab; content between two H2s belongs to the
first. Content between H1 and the first H2 is silently dropped — put intro
under an H2 (e.g. "Overview"). Single-section docs may omit H2s (whole doc =
one tab).

**Doc scale:** ≤25 sections + ≤15 Mermaid diagrams (every section renders
up-front; every Mermaid re-renders per tab switch) — split larger material.

## Inline · lists · tables · images · code

- Inline: `**bold**` · `*italic*` · `~~strike~~` · `` `code` `` · `[text](url)`
- Lists: `-` unordered · `1.` ordered · `- [ ]` / `- [x]` tasks
- Tables: standard GFM pipe tables
- Images: `![alt](https://url/img.png)` — absolute URLs only, descriptive alt
- Video: a bare video URL alone on its own line renders as a player — a
  `github.com/user-attachments/assets/<id>` URL (paste a video into a GitHub
  issue/PR to mint one) or any absolute URL ending `.mp4`/`.webm`/`.mov`/`.ogg`.
  NEVER wrap it in `![]()` / `[]()` — bare triggers the player.
- Code: fenced with a language hint (```` ```python ````)

## Color classes

`class1`–`class4` — on callouts, stat cards, mermaid nodes, linear steps.
Choose the class by meaning; the theme decides the color. Keep one class per
semantic role across the doc (e.g. `class1` = primary, `class2` = supporting,
`class3` = positive/done, `class4` = caution/warning). Consistency >
specific choice.

## Callouts

```
> [!class1]
> Callout content.
```
Cap ≤280 (one short paragraph). class1–class4.

## Stat cards

````
```stats
:::class1
value: 87%
label: User satisfaction
description: Up 12% from last quarter
:::class2
value: 1.2M
label: Active users
```
````

| Field | Status | Cap | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `value` | req | ≤12 | short token (`87%`, `1.2M`) — not sentences |
| `label` | req | ≤28 | one short noun phrase |
| `description` | opt | one short line | omit if no signal |

Layout: 2 per row; trailing odd card spans the row.

## Mermaid

````
```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Start]:::class1 --> B[Middle]:::class2 --> C[End]:::class3
```
````

Class via `:::classN` on nodes. The app injects `classDef` — NEVER write
`classDef`, `fill:`, or any style directive. Node label cap ≤24 (long labels
balloon auto-sized nodes).

**Quote labels with special characters** — unquoted node text is parsed as
Mermaid grammar. Any label containing `/`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`,
`<`, `>`, `#`, `:`, `;`, or a quote MUST be double-quoted inside the brackets
-> else *"Syntax error in text"* and nothing renders. Notably `A[/text/]` =
the parallelogram shape, so a literal path like `/lease/mail/*` breaks unless
quoted.

```
GOOD:  AD["/admin/user-credentials/"]:::class3
       N["count > 0"]:::class2
BAD:   AD[/admin/user-credentials/]      (parsed as a parallelogram shape → error)
       N[count > 0]                      (> is a grammar token → error)
```

Cylinder/stadium shapes are fine as-is — `DB[(secrets.db)]`, `X([ready])` —
quote only the inner text, not the shape brackets.

## Linear

````
```linear
Step 1 :::class1 -> Step 2 :::class2 -> Step 3 :::class3
```
````
Steps separated by `->`, optional `:::classN`. Renders vertically — one step
per row, top→bottom (never horizontal). Step text cap ≤48.

## Never

- H4–H6 · blockquotes (except callouts) · footnotes · raw HTML
- Color / font / size / theme / visual mentions (the theme owns styling)
- Content between H1 and the first H2 (silently dropped — use an H2)
- Comma-separated `tags` (must be a YAML list)
- `classDef` / `fill:` / style directives inside Mermaid
- Unquoted Mermaid labels containing special characters

## Open in md-converter

A doc whose `body` lives in the DB already opens in the app from the GUI
("open in md-converter ↗" on the Roadmap/Docs card) — author nothing there.

When committing a **standalone** themed-markdown file to the repo (a README,
or a rendered `docs_sc/` page meant to be read on GitHub), drop a one-click
badge in its preamble — between `# Title` and the first `##` (shows on
GitHub, dropped from the render by the preamble rule):

```markdown
[![Open in md-converter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-md--converter-6b46c1?style=flat-square)](https://md-converter.designs-os.com/?url=https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/<path>)
```

Fill `<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>` with the file''s GitHub location (any
subdirectory depth). Public repos only — the badge fetches the raw file in
the reader''s browser (no server/auth). Destination unknown -> keep the
placeholders and tell the user to fill them.',

  'substrate',

  1,
  '# web_search — look it up through the engine

`sc search` is the one web search verb every shell has, on every harness.
It posts your query to the engine API with your own bearer token; the host
calls Tavily with the instance''s API key and returns the results. The key never
reaches a shell, and a sandboxed shell needs no network egress.

## When to search

- A fact that changes: a library''s current API, a release note, a CLI flag, a
  version''s known bug, an error message you cannot explain from the code.
- Before guessing at an external service''s protocol or a package''s behaviour.
- Never for anything the repo, its catalogue, or your own memory already
  answers.

## The verb

```bash
sc search "<query>"                      # 5 results + a short synthesized answer
sc search "<query>" --max 10             # 1..20 results
sc search "<query>" --depth advanced     # deeper crawl, slower
sc search "<query>" --json               # raw payload: answer, results[] (title, url, snippet, score)
```

Output is a numbered list: title, URL, snippet. Treat snippets as leads, not
proof — open the URL that matters (`curl -sL <url>` or your harness''s fetch
tool) before you rely on it, and cite the URL in what you write.

## When it fails

Every failure names its cause and carries no secret:

| Message starts with | Meaning | Do |
|---|---|---|
| `web search is not configured` | no key on this instance | Tell the FnB: set it in the GUI → **Scripts → Web Search**. Do not work around it with a key of your own. |
| `Tavily rejected the API key` | the stored key is invalid or revoked | Tell the FnB to rotate it in the same GUI card. |
| `Tavily plan usage limit` / `rate limit` | quota exhausted | Stop searching; say so; continue from what you have. |
| `Tavily unreachable` | host network failure | Retry once later; then surface it. |
| `the engine API is required` | your shell is not API-wired | Boot via the launcher with the server up. |

Search results are not persisted anywhere by the engine. What you learn goes
where any other finding goes: the narrative, a decision, or the work itself.',
