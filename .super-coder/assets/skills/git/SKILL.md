description: Git events for a Subfloor shell — GitHub capability recovery, merging a stack the FnB hands you, after-merge cleanup, and what never enters Git. The every-session rules (sync, branch, PR, merge gate, finish) live in your boot.

# git — the event procedures

Your boot's VERSION CONTROL section carries the every-session rules: sync the
base, branch before you build, commit → push → PR → stop, the merge gate's two
forms, the disposable `shell/<shortname>` base, and the finish gate. This skill
holds what fires on an event.

One repo at its root -> plain `git` (cwd = repo root) is safe. Project = this
repo minus `.super-coder/`. In a tracking fork the engine (`.super-coder/`) is
gitignored, materialized by `sc update`, and authored upstream in Subfloor —
NEVER commit or edit anything under it. In the Subfloor source repository
(`git ls-files --error-unmatch .super-coder/schema.sql` exits 0) `.super-coder/`
is tracked project source and `.sc-state/engine.ref` is not the delivery unit;
engine changes still land by branch and PR.

## GitHub capability boundary

`sc launch` and `sc restart` re-resolve Git transport and GitHub API
capabilities from the host on every invocation, including `--no-build` forms.
`build`, `enter`, and an already running sandbox do not refresh auth. Pass = the
lifecycle summary says `ready` for the operation you need; `unavailable` and
`unverified` are NEVER readiness claims.

Preserve the configured `origin` transport. For SSH, fix the host agent and
load an authorized GitHub identity; NEVER copy or mount private keys. For
HTTPS/API, fix a scoped host `SC_GH_TOKEN` or the host `gh` OAuth login. Then
run `sc launch` or `sc restart`; the running sandbox remains unchanged
until that refresh. NEVER rewrite the remote or start an interactive login
inside the sandbox to work around a missing capability.

## Merging a stack (only when the FnB hands you one)

Merge bottom-up, retargeting before each merge — never rely on GitHub's auto-retarget:

1. `gh pr view <n> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` -> clean.
2. `gh pr merge <low> --squash --delete-branch`.
3. BEFORE the next merge: `gh pr edit <next> --base main` — deleting the merged base otherwise orphans the PR above it (GitHub closes it `CONFLICTING`, base ref gone).
4. Re-check `MERGEABLE` -> merge. Repeat up the stack.

PR already orphaned (base deleted under it) -> the head branch still holds the commits; reopen the SAME PR, don't rebuild:

1. `git push origin <merged-sha>:refs/heads/<deleted-branch>` — `<merged-sha>` = `gh pr view <merged-pr> --json headRefOid`.
2. `gh pr reopen <closed-pr>` -> `gh pr edit <closed-pr> --base main`.
3. Verify `MERGEABLE` -> delete the recreated branch again.

## After a merge — clean up local

Only after the PR is merged:

A managed worktree whose Sprint is already `completed` is the exception: the
Sprint cleanup service owns its reset after live turns exit. Do not race that
service with manual Git cleanup. A pending or failed cleanup makes the slot
unavailable until `sc sprint cleanup-status --sprint <id>` reports succeeded;
the originating Planner or FnB uses the Sprint retry surface.

1. Re-pin the base. In a worktree `git checkout main` fails (main is checked out at the repo root; git refuses a branch checked out elsewhere) -> `git checkout shell/<shortname> && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main`. Admin at repo root: `git pull --ff-only` on main.
2. `git branch -d <branch>`. Squash-merged -> `-d` refuses (commits aren't ancestors of main); confirm the PR shows *merged* on the remote -> `git branch -D <branch>`.
3. `git fetch --prune`.

NEVER delete a branch carrying unmerged, un-PR'd work — no PR = lost work.

## Never commit the engine or derived files

- In a fork `/.super-coder/` is gitignored — never force-add anything under it.
- Gitignored + regenerated, never commit: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `opencode.json`, `.claude/skills/`, `.sc-state/engine.ref.prev` (ephemeral rollback pointer).
- From a worktree, commit only your project's authored files. Generated
  snapshots and `_sc` renders live under ignored `.sc-state/local/` and never
  enter Git. `.sc-state/engine.ref` is the deliberate tracked exception: it is
  the dependency pin and is updated by `sc update`.

## Notes

- Before destructive ops, confirm the repo — `git -C <abs-path>` if ever in doubt.
- Multi-shell: each shell boots into its own worktree at `.sc-worktrees/<shortname>/` on branch `shell/<shortname>`; the launcher keeps the base pinned to `origin/main`. Admin shell = the one exception: repo root on `main`, committing there by mandate.
- UI preview: worktree edits do NOT show on the fork's main dev server. `sc preview` (start once from the main checkout if not running) serves every shell's worktree UI live (HMR) on the fork's `dev_port`, one subdomain each: `http://<shortname>.localhost:<dev_port>/`. The `post-commit` hook prints your URL after each commit — surface that line to the FnB.
