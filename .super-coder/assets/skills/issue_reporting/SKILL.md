description: Report engine defects upstream — the moment a sc command fails or lies, a skill contradicts your reality, the API blocks a documented workflow, or you work around the engine to proceed. File a GitHub issue on Subfloor; your repo's app bugs stay in the fork.

# issue_reporting — the backwards flow

An engine defect fixed upstream reaches every fork via `sc update`; worked
around silently, every fork re-derives the workaround. File the issue while
the failure is on screen — NEVER batch to session end.

A workaround IS a report: deviating from a skill's steps, wrapping a command,
or hand-patching state to proceed -> you hold the exact repro; file it now.

## Boundary — engine vs fork

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| **Upstream — file it** | anything the engine materializes/owns: `.super-coder/`, `sc` + every subcommand, engine skills (this catalogue), the boot doc render, the sandbox / dev kit, `sc update` + migrations, the `_sc` API + `sc mem` |
| **Fork — don't** | the repo's app code, DB-canonical fork-local skills, operator-owned host config |

Unsure -> "would the same problem hit any other fork?" yes = upstream.

## Triggers

Each row = a real engine defect filed by a fork shell doing ordinary work.
Match the left column -> file.

| You hit | Real case |
|---|---|
| A `sc` command fails out of the box | `sc verify` always aborted — its own render step needed `SC_ADMIN` it never set (#227) |
| A command exits green without doing the work | `sc test` silently fell back to unittest when pytest was missing — green-washed suites (#219) |
| The documented remedy is a closed loop | `sc lint` said "run `sc deps` first," but deps skips pip in the sandbox — tool unobtainable from inside the box (#246) |
| A skill instructs tools/paths your seat doesn't have | a sandbox skill drove raw host-only `ssh`/`virsh` paths (#248) |
| A skill contradicts what the engine actually does | skills still taught raw `sqlite3` against the substrate DB after memory went API-only (#226) |
| The API refuses what the skills document | `sc mem doc add` 400'd standalone docs the docs + onboard skills both document (#245) |
| A permission wall mid-workflow | a dev shell could read a planner-owned feature but 404'd advancing its status (#224) |
| Every write suddenly 401s | rebuild didn't re-mint api_keys — all live shells locked out until an API bounce (#214) |
| `sc update` / migrate wedges or half-applies | migration failed partway, retry died on `duplicate column name` (#229); update aborted crossing a commit that deleted an engine file (#209) |
| A structural foot-gun keeps re-biting you | the cwd trap — `cd` to root for `sc`, then bare git hit the wrong tree, "my edits vanished" (#225) |
| The sandbox can reach something it shouldn't | `do_push` src/dest weren't contained — sandbox→host escape (#228) |

Stale guidance (skill says X, engine does Y) files the same as a crash.

## Capture — while the failure is on screen

- **engine ref** = `sc engine-ref` — first line of every report (Subfloor's engine commit)
- **staleness** = compare that ref to upstream head:
  `git ls-remote https://github.com/jedbjorn/subfloor HEAD` — write
  `current` or `behind head <sha7>`. Behind + the symptom is a missing
  command or a skill/engine mismatch -> the fix may already be shipped:
  ask your FnB for `sc update` first, and file only if the defect
  survives the update (or updating isn't an option — then the staleness
  note carries that caveat). Triage reads this line to tell a live
  engine defect from a stale fork build.
- **fork + seat**: repo name, shell flavor, sandbox/host
- **ran / followed**: the exact command, or skill name + step
- **expected vs actual**: exact output, trimmed to the failing lines
- **workaround**: what unblocked you, or "blocked, none found"

The issue is public: NEVER paste api keys, tokens, secrets, or private paths.

## File it

```bash
# 1. dedup — someone may have hit it first
gh issue list --repo jedbjorn/subfloor --search "<symptom keywords>" --state all

# 2. file — title: [<fork>] <area>: <one-line symptom>
gh issue create --repo jedbjorn/subfloor \
  --title "[<fork>] <area>: <symptom>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
- engine ref: <sha from .sc-state/engine.ref> · <current | behind head <sha7>>
- fork/seat: <repo> · <shell flavor> · <sandbox|host>

**Ran / followed:** <command or skill+step>
**Expected:** <what the docs/skill promise>
**Actual:** <exact trimmed output>
**Workaround:** <what unblocked you, or "blocked">
EOF
)"
```

`jedbjorn/subfloor` = engine upstream; confirm: `git remote get-url super-coder`.

Dedup hit -> comment your engine ref + repro on the existing issue; do NOT
file a duplicate.

No `gh` / no network from your seat -> save the identical body as a fork flag:
`sc mem flag open "[Engine] <symptom> | Blocker for: <x>" --name UP-###`, then
message the **admin** shell to relay it upstream.

## Authorized curation recommendation

The `curate` skill has one FnB-authorized exception to the normal enhancement
gate below. When a recurring L&S cluster may warrant a reusable upstream skill,
the curating shell may search and file the recommendation directly without
asking the FnB first.

Search all upstream issues before opening anything. Add evidence to a matching
recommendation, or open one titled `skills: recommend <topic>` containing the
trigger, repeated incidents, proposed ownership boundary, expected users, why
existing skills do not cover it, and a compact candidate procedure.

This route recommends; it never creates or promotes a skill. Keep one compressed
L&S entry until a reviewed upstream skill ships and is granted. If issue search
or creation is unavailable, surface the failure to the FnB, keep the L&S, and
create no local skill or asset. Deliberate fork-specific authoring remains the
Planner-owned workflow in `fork_skill_design`.

## Rules

- One defect per issue. Batch nothing.
- Observed failure = the bar for filing unasked; enhancement ideas ("the
  engine should…") go to your FnB first, except the authorized curation
  recommendation route above.
- Filing ≠ unblocked: defect blocks work -> also open a fork flag linking the
  issue URL.
