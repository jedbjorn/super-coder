# sprint_pln — govern the armed Sprint

Load `sprint_protocol` first; it holds the lifecycle, wake types, inbox
commands, relay contract, body limits, artifact paths, receipt recovery, and
authority boundary. This skill holds only the Planner's steps after
`sprint_prep` arms the Sprint.

## What you can read

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| Whole Sprint: lifecycle, participants with current routes, units, dependencies, PRs, health | `sc sprint show --sprint <id>` |
| Messages addressed to you | `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` |
| Exact bound spec body | `sc sprint spec-revision --sprint <id> --document <id> [--body-only]` |
| PR-watcher evidence behind a stalled gate | `sc sprint watcher-state --sprint <id>` |
| Post-Sprint cleanup evidence | `sc sprint cleanup-status --sprint <id>` |
| Bounded history packet: judgments, pauses, anomalies, follow-ups | `sc sprint compile-report --sprint <id> --limit 50` |
| Candidate routes and what each supports | `sc models list [<harness>]`; preview one with `sc models resolve <harness> [<model>] [--effort <level>]` |
| Shell roster, feature, spec tasks, settled decisions | `sc mem get shells`, `sc mem get roadmap`, `sc mem get tasks --feature <id>`, `sc mem get decisions` |

`show` participants carry `shell_id`, `role`, `harness`, `model`, `effort`,
`binding_status`, and `route_revision`; units carry `developer`, `reviewer`,
`disposition`, `prerequisite_ids`, and `pull_requests`. A Thinking level
applies only to controlled routes: `null` model + `null` effort is Harness
default, and Vibe takes no effort.

## Route the entry

| Trigger | Route |
|---|---|
| Sprint decision, merged-work handoff, question, blocker, relay | Inspect `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>` once; handle that message. |
| Engine-wide completion or cleanup receipt | Inspect receipt + terminal state directly; it is informational — do not run the Sprint inbox, accept it, or close again. |
| Live FnB instruction | Act under board override; name FnB authority in durable evidence. |

You receive no PR-event wakes; red/green/closed/merged facts go to Developers.

## Durable running loop

Read only trigger-required lifecycle, unit, dependency, route, PR, expectation,
and anomaly facts. Browser presence is not progress.

```text
sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>
```

Dispatch every dependency-ready lane; returned ids are wake identities.
Disposition + messages are release facts. Stable assignment generations and
occupied lanes make dispatch repeat-safe.

- Keep dependencies as hard sequence; restructure current projection under
  Planner authority, record why, and never rewrite completed history.
- Developers own local/PR proof, review/fix/merge. Complete code + unavailable
  local gate -> registered CI: pending wait, red fix, green review; browser skip
  is non-failing. With fallback, Planner NEVER mutates packages/toolchains or
  runs repair. No checks/untrustworthy watcher after one read -> blocker.
  Reviewers own verdicts/conformance; do not proxy handoffs/judgments.
- Record Reviewer decision id + exact action + receipt; never rewrite rationale
  as Planner judgment.
- Reviewer-approved Planner/FnB spec rebind:
  pause -> `sc mem doc edit` -> `sc sprint rebind-spec --sprint <id>
  --document <id> --expected-revision <old-sha256> --reason <decision>` ->
  replan -> resume. Pass = old/new hashes + changed boolean; conflict -> reread.
- Relay Developer integrity evidence, impact, and recommendation to the
  Reviewer. Send required context before pausing: paused Sprint relay is
  unavailable.

## Reviewer decisions and Planner actions

For a required-reply Reviewer decision, keep this order:

1. Re-run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`; verify the assigned Reviewer + retain the id.
2. Send a linked acknowledgement (`--intent information --reply-to <decision-message-id>`).
3. Require the reply command to confirm its durable message and wake; retry the
   same command/key if ambiguous.
4. `sc sprint accept --sprint <id> --message <decision-message-id>`.
5. Only after acceptance, execute the requested transition without
   re-adjudicating it. The linked reply must precede any pause or abort that
   makes the relay unavailable.

Record decision id + reply, acceptance, and action receipts. Clean conformance
closes atomically and sends an informational receipt; no reply/accept is
needed. If an action fails a lifecycle/authority/disposition precondition,
send the refusal + durable state to the Reviewer (or FnB for an override),
substitute nothing, and stop.

### Pause or resume

Pause for a Reviewer decision or safe Planner restructuring; preserve partial
artifacts, interrupt intent, judgment, and evidence:

```text
sc sprint pause --sprint <id> --reason <decision-or-restructure-reason>
```

Resume only after recording recovery/restructure and reconciling native runs,
unread messages, wakes, units, PRs, capacity, and spec drift:

```text
sc sprint resume --sprint <id> [--reason <validated-reconciliation-reason>]
```

Preserve the current conformance owner on ordinary resume. Replace that owner
only while paused, only with an eligible participating Reviewer, and always
record a reason:

```text
sc sprint resume --sprint <id> \
  --conformance-reviewer-shell <replacement-shell-id> \
  --reason <ownership-replacement-reason>
```

Require the receipt and board projection to show the replacement owner and a
new ownership generation before treating the Sprint as resumed. An exhausted
recovery wake = bounded manual evidence: preserve the unread message + failed
wake, involve FnB, create no recursive fallback. Drift informs but never
silently blocks resume.

Aborted-Sprint PR ownership repair belongs to the originating Planner. Keep
the replacement Sprint paused; establish old/new identity, then:

```text
sc sprint reconcile-pr --sprint <replacement-id> --repository <owner/repo> \
  --pr <number> --work-unit <replacement-unit-id> --reason <recovery-reason>
```

It refuses a live source or target Sprint, a non-originating Planner, an
invalid/owned target, and a closed-unmerged PR. Require a separate Reviewer
decision before resuming.

### Modify, recall, repeat, reassign, or reroute

Cancel unreleased scope with retained terminal reason/Reviewer id:

```text
sc sprint cancel-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> --reason <reason>
```

Edit an unreleased lane; omitted fields stay, `--clear-dependencies` means none:

```text
sc sprint replan-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> \
  [--developer-shell <id>] [--reviewer-shell <id>] [--title <title>] \
  [--expected-output-file <path>] [--task <task-id>] [--wave <n>] \
  [--depends-on <work-unit-id> | --clear-dependencies] \
  [--output-kind code|report-only|no-code]
```

Never edit a released lane in place. Pause -> recall the unmerged lane
(`sc sprint recall-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> --reason <reason>`) ->
replan -> resume. Recall preserves message/event history, returns only
unmerged work to planned, and refuses terminal/PR-bound work. PR-bound work
stays; plan replacement or use reconciliation. Resume creates a fresh
assignment generation. One spec task may govern repeated verification or
replacement lanes; each lane lists it once — do not duplicate the spec task.

Close a released lane terminal when its work finished out-of-band (a PR that
merged while paused) or its lane is abandoned — the PR-bound case recall
refuses:

```text
sc sprint resolve-unit --sprint <id> --work-unit <id> \
  --to completed|cancelled --reason <reason>
```

Paused-only; retires the lane's open expectations, supersedes its PR links
(registration kept for reconcile-pr), and wakes both seats.

To change a future assignment or review route, pause the armed Sprint, take
each participant's `shell_id` and current route from `sc sprint show`, preview
the replacement with `sc models resolve`, then replace the route and resume:

```text
sc sprint reroute-participant --sprint <id> --participant-shell <id> \
  --harness <harness> [--model <model>] [--effort <effort>] \
  [--route <display-route>]
```

Prepared Sprints may reroute directly. Reroute declared participants only. On
a decline, preserve the reason and choose a replacement from current capacity;
ask the Reviewer only if review/conformance judgment changes.

### Re-enter after conformance

The Reviewer decision names findings; governing tasks (existing for the same
scope, new title/description for new scope); and grouping, waves,
dependencies, routing, capacity. Preserve it; do not absorb extra or
post-Sprint scope or maximize occupancy.

```text
sc mem task add "<task-title>" --feature <feature-id> \
  --doc <governing-spec-document-id> --seq <next-seq> \
  --desc "<task-description>"

sc sprint plan-unit --sprint <id> \
  --developer-shell <id> --reviewer-shell <id> --title <title> \
  --expected-output-file <path> --task <task-id> \
  [--task <task-id>] [--wave <n>] [--depends-on <work-unit-id>] \
  [--output-kind code|report-only|no-code]
```

Reuse a task for exact repair/repeat; add only genuinely new scope. Bind every
task, then confirm routes, dependency graph, and capacity plan match the
decision. Release ready lanes with `sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>`. The
engine sends the next delivery-terminal wake; you do not initiate conformance.

### Conclude or abort

Clean `record-conformance` by the Reviewer atomically stores conformance,
follow-ups, the Reviewer-authored final report, completion, and your
informational receipt. On it, verify Sprint/reports/outcome/completed state.
Do not run `complete`; do not author a second report; do not manually close
peer chats.

The initial completion receipt reports `cleanup_state=pending`: delivery is
finished, but managed worktrees are not reusable yet. Stop for the engine-wide
cleanup receipt; do not poll or manually reset participant trees. On
`cleanup_state=succeeded`, treat the slots as reusable. On failure, inspect
once and retry only after correcting the named condition:

```text
sc sprint cleanup-status --sprint <id>
sc sprint cleanup --sprint <id> --key <stable-retry-key>
```

Require `created`, cleanup request id, action, exact target ids, and aggregate
projection. Reuse the key only for the same request. Abort only on a Reviewer
decision or FnB override; it is terminal and deletes nothing:

```text
sc sprint abort --sprint <id> --reason <reason> [--outcome <outcome>]
```

## Handoffs and stop

Never dispatch the next wave from merge observation. The merged-work handoff
wake is the only normal next-wave dispatch trigger. On it:

1. Run `sc sprint inbox --sprint <id>`; inspect the merged handoff + unit/dependency state.
2. Handle earlier informational items and `accept` each, including the handoff.
3. Finish reconciliation and Planner bookkeeping; no work remains.
4. As the literal final action run `sc sprint dispatch --sprint <id>`.
5. Require durable assignments + wakes, then stop. Run no trailing command.
   Empty dispatch remains final; investigate only on a later durable wake.

On an initial clean completion receipt, verify the named Sprint is terminal and
record `cleanup_state=pending`; run no close command. Stop until the
engine-authored cleanup success or failure receipt arrives.
