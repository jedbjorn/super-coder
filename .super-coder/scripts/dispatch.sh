# ── Windows VM broker (HOST-side; drives the test VM for sandboxed forks) ──────

# Supervision: `launch` brings it up (and `down` stops it) automatically when the
# fork has linked a VM, so it tracks the sandbox lifecycle with no extra step. For

Subfloor — forkable shell substrate — full command reference (./sc help for the short chart)

  Host support: Linux-only — Arch Linux (including CachyOS) and Ubuntu LTS.
  subfloor <verb> [args] is ./sc <verb> [args] from the enclosing checkout.

  ./sc install             first-launch bootstrap for a fork (requirements, harness, first shell)
  ./sc ensure-harness      install claude + opencode + codex + vibe + kimi if missing (official native installers, no npm)
  ./sc doctor              runtime readiness: docker (rootless/rootful) + harness login — or, under
                             runtime host, the host process contract + harness login
  ./sc update              fetch + materialize the engine (gitignored dep) + reconcile IN PLACE (migrate, sync skills, map);
                             --no-fetch skips the fetch · --ref <tag|sha> pins a version · blocks on local engine edits (--force discards them)
                             first runs git pull --ff-only for any tracked checkout; source repos then reconcile FROM that tree.
                             Advisory, never blocking: an unsafe/offline pull WARNS and engine update continues from the current
                             checkout. Update never merges, rebases or resets. --no-fetch skips checkout and engine network sync.
  ./sc update-harnesses    refresh the harness CLIs the SHELLS run: rolls the harness epoch + rebuilds the sandbox image
                             (they are image-owned — activate that exact build with ./sc restart --no-build)
                             without docker, updates this host's CLIs instead — there the host IS the runtime
  ./sc harness-status      report the harness CLI versions inside the sandbox + whether the image owes a harness rebuild
                             (a model the shells cannot reach is nearly always this — see .super-coder/docs/harness-freshness.md)
  ./sc docker-cache-gc     remove unused host-global Docker build cache older than seven days
                             --until <duration> changes the age · --all removes all unused cache
  ./sc rollback            Admin-only undo of a bad update — restore the paired control-plane + engine generation
                             --engine-only repairs a new-engine / unchanged-state half floor
  ./sc feature             list optional infrastructure (pg · windows · tailnet · pm2) and its instance.json state
  ./sc feature enable <f>  create or point at one instance.json block (disable removes it)
  ./sc eject               ONE-WAY: stop tracking upstream and own the engine — un-gitignore + stage .super-coder/ as fork source (confirm-gated)
  ./sc remove              safely uninstall subfloor from this repo after a verified DB backup
                             --dry-run previews; --yes skips confirmation, never safety gates
  ./sc rebuild             Admin-only verified rebuild of the private control plane
  ./sc migrate             Admin-only application of pending engine changes
  ./sc migration new <slug>
                           allocate the next free migration number, write the standard skeleton, and update the source removal-test allowlist
  ./sc snapshot            Admin-only serialization of private instance content
                             live-state commands (rebuild · migrate · verify · snapshot · render · clean-db) act on the SHARED live
                             instance at the main checkout, so they REFUSE from a linked worktree rather than substitute it, naming
                             the target declined (decision #81); -h/--help still answers from any checkout. render-check is the
                             source-pure one: it verifies the CALLER's engine sources and local artifacts, and names the checkout it read.
  ./sc mem <cmd> [args]    a shell's own memory, over the engine API (get/state/seed/lns/decision/flag/roadmap/doc/narrative);
                             already wired to this launched shell, identity resolved by the engine — no DB path, no direct-DB fallback. `./sc mem which` to orient
  ./sc pr subscribe --repository <owner/name> --pr <number>
                           subscribe the authenticated Developer shell to engine-wide PR event wakes
  ./sc sprint <cmd>        authenticated Sprints v2 actions (run without a command for the full verb list)
                             caller identity is resolved by the engine; report and review bodies use files, and mutating retries carry stable keys where required
  ./sc token               print the browser sign-in operator token — an Admin/operator recovery capability;
                             stdout carries only the token and failure names the supported service action
  sc engine-ref            print the full engine pin from the canonical live checkout — safe from any shell
                             worktree; stdout is the 40-character SHA only
  ./sc job start -- <cmd>  run a long local command (suite/bench/build) detached + supervised — it
                             survives your session; completion lands in YOUR inbox as a result row
                             (--label <slug> names it, --timeout <s> kills the wedged process group)
  ./sc job wait <id>       bounded foreground wait, ≤550s slice — exit 0 done · 2 still running
                             (drain your inbox between slices); list/status/tail/kill complete the set
  ./sc models refresh      refresh local model routes (same action as Shells → Refresh models)
  ./sc models resolve <h> [<model>] [--effort <level>] [--shell <shortname>]
                             print one exact, locally runnable high-effort call; list [harness] shows routes
  ./sc visual-qa <mode>    viewport screenshot QA: ci boots/captures · run captures a local app · init scaffolds config
  sc map-sql "<query>"     read-only query of the repository catalogue (`dr_*`)
  sc map-schema [dr_table] list live dr_* objects or stable column/index metadata — read-only, no arbitrary SQL
  sc map-sql-rw            Cartographer-only catalogue authoring when its skill names the exact procedure
  ./sc skill <cmd>         skill catalogue surface: list · grant <name> <shell>... · revoke <name> <shell>... · rm <name> · retire <name> · unretire <name>
                             shells by id or shortname; rm refuses engine skills — retire/unretire manages the fork retire
                             list (active tracked/local retire path, rides updates); snapshot after writes to persist
  ./sc artifact-mode       inspect the local-only artifact paths (mode switching is retired)
  ./sc render              render flat _sc files under the active artifact policy
  ./sc render-check        fail if the active flat _sc files drift from the DB render (hermetic check)
  ./sc analytics sweep     parse each harness's on-disk token usage for this repo into session_token_usage
                             (incremental + idempotent; --harness <name> · --quiet · --full re-parses everything).
                             Also runs at boot and behind the GUI Analytics tab
  ./sc map                 scan the host repo into the dr_* catalogue (re-runnable)
  ./sc map finalize [--json]
                           refresh + report live/snapshot/install/source/Admin/notice/flag evidence; never owns those actions
  ./sc map-extractor install <worktree-file>
                           validate + atomically install one Cartographer-authored extractor and write its SHA-256 receipt
  ./sc map-setup           wire the auto-remap git hooks (core.hooksPath) + map — the cartographer's one-shot
  ./sc seed-skills         upsert assets/skills/ into the live DB (+ regenerate the seed migration — source repo only)
  ./sc search "<query>" [--max N] [--depth basic|advanced] [--json]
                           web search via the engine API (Tavily; key set in GUI → Scripts → Web Search)
  ./sc context --task <id> | --work-unit <id> [--json]
                           one focused read of a task or work unit: Assignment · Goal · Authority · Blockers · Boundaries · Resources
  ./sc init                seed a fresh fork's first user + shell (run once after install)

  Sandbox (docker — the default way to run; allow-everything is safe because the
  container only sees this repo + your harness creds):
  ./sc runtime [mode]      show or select the lifecycle runtime: sandbox (docker, the default) · host
                             (review server as a supervised host process + shells booted on this host;
                             no docker anywhere). launch/enter/down/restart/logs/build/update-harnesses/
                             doctor/update follow the selection; ./sc install --runtime host sets it at install
  ./sc sandbox-memory [SIZE|default]
                           show or set the sandbox RAM ceiling; swap is bounded to the same total
                             default targets 12 GiB while reserving 20% of Docker-visible RAM
  ./sc launch              build the exact base/fork image, start the sandbox, and run declared provisioning
                             (runtime host: start the host review server + configured brokers; no image)
                             states: absent · invalid · failed · stale · ready; failed setup retains container + evidence
                             every launch refreshes configured-origin Git + GitHub API capabilities;
                             --no-build reuses only a ready labeled image but still refreshes auth
  ./sc admin               boot the sole active Admin directly on the host (no Docker or API required)
  ./sc enter [shortname]   boot an interactive shell only when declared provisioning is ready
                             a shortname skips the picker (same as enter-<shortname>)
                             --devkit-repair enters state repair without claiming readiness
  ./sc enter-<shortname>   enter that shell directly when ready (skip the shell picker)
                             harness: --harness <name> or HARNESS=<name> forces it; else when
                             >1 harness is on PATH you're prompted (per-launch, not persisted)
  ./sc alias               install or refresh the `subfloor` command for bash + fish
                             --status reports · --remove drops it · --print bash|fish shows the function
  ./sc make-cleanup        one-time: retire a fork's make dos-* wiring (Makefile include + aliases.mk)
                             --dry-run previews; runbook: docs/README.md "Retire the make aliases"
  ./sc run <shortname>     headless boot: render + exec the harness NON-interactively (claude · codex ·
                             opencode · kimi); -p "<prompt>" · --harness <h> · -m <model> · --effort;
                             refuses a shell that already has a live session
  ./sc down                stop + remove the sandbox container
  ./sc restart             confirm + WAL-safe backup, fully bounce, then health-check managed services
                             default refreshes image-owned harnesses; every restart refreshes host GitHub capabilities
                             --yes skips the prompt · --no-build reuses the image without skipping auth refresh
  ./sc build               (re)build the sandbox image · --harnesses also expires the baked harness CLIs so they reinstall
  ./sc logs                tail the sandbox server logs

  Primitives (run inside the container; also the no-docker host escape hatch):
  ./sc serve               run the review layer (api + static UI) in the foreground
  ./sc boot [shortname]    direct interactive launch (host/no-docker primitive)
  ./sc deps [args]         run the fork-declared deps argv; exit 78 when not configured
  ./sc test [args]         run the fork-declared test argv exactly
  ./sc lint [args]         run the fork-declared lint argv exactly
  ./sc typecheck [args]    run the fork-declared typecheck argv exactly
                             all four validate .subfloor/dev-kit.json, preserve child output/status,
                             and never infer a manifest, tool, file set, or fallback

  Windows VM broker (run on the HOST — drives the test VM for sandboxed forks;
  holds the ssh key + virsh so the fork never does. See .super-coder/docs/windows-vm-broker.md).
  `launch` brings it up automatically when a VM is linked; `down` stops it:
  ./sc vm status [--json] read broker, VM, SSH, and MCP-tunnel state without mutation;
                           includes relay, endpoint, and active-adapter state
  ./sc vm start [--json]  start only when off, then wait within a bounded SSH-readiness budget
  ./sc vm push SRC [DEST] [--json]
                           stage a permitted local artifact through the configured transfer directory
  ./sc vm exec [--command-file FILE] [--json] -- COMMAND...
                           execute one guest command through SSH without caller-built JSON
  ./sc vm capture [--output PATH] [--json]
                           save a validated screenshot artifact and return viewable metadata
  ./sc vm mcp status|up|down [--json]
                           inspect, start+verify, or stop the managed MCP tunnel and relay
  ./sc vm reset --off [--json]
                           restore the testing snapshot and confirm the VM is powered off
  ./sc vm test init local | ./sc vm test init ssh HOST
                           select Halo-local or Dev-through-ForceCommand transport
  ./sc vm test status|acquire|release|start|stop|exec|push|pull|snapshot|reset|baseline
                           drive the fixed W10C-Testing controller; run --help for exact forms
  ./sc vm test release --force
                           clear a lease whose token was lost, so no seat waits out the TTL
  ./sc vm-broker           run the broker in the foreground (unix socket)
  ./sc vm-bake             HOST-side: graceful shutdown + (re)bake the clean snapshot after provisioning
                             (deliberately NOT a broker verb — the sandbox must never redefine 'clean')
  ./sc vm-broker-up        start it in the background (nohup + pidfile); self-skips if unlinked/already up
  ./sc vm-broker-down      stop the backgrounded broker
  ./sc vm-broker-sock      print the broker's socket path
  ./sc vm-broker-install   supervise via a systemd --user unit (survives logout/reboot)
  ./sc vm-broker-uninstall remove the systemd unit
  ./sc vm-mcp-relay        in-SANDBOX half of the GUI seam: up [port] / down / status —
                             TCP 127.0.0.1:18000 → the broker's vm-mcp.sock tunnel;
                             managed adapter injection supplies the harness definition and
                             `./sc vm mcp up` brings the endpoint online

  Tailnet broker (run on the HOST — drives the tailnet for sandboxed forks; holds
  the already-`tailscale up` node so the fork never holds a tailnet credential.
  See .super-coder/docs/tailscale-broker.md). `launch` brings it up when a tailnet is linked:
  ./sc ts-broker           run the broker in the foreground (unix socket)
  ./sc ts-broker-up        start it in the background (nohup + pidfile); self-skips if unlinked/already up
  ./sc ts-broker-down      stop the backgrounded broker
  ./sc ts-broker-sock      print the broker's socket path
  ./sc ts-broker-install   supervise via a systemd --user unit (survives logout/reboot)
  ./sc ts-broker-uninstall remove the systemd unit

  pm2 broker (run on the HOST — lets a sandboxed shell observe + manage the
  host's pm2-supervised app stack: status, health, logs, restart — fail-closed
  on the `pm2` block's `processes` allowlist. See .super-coder/docs/pm2-broker.md).
  `launch` brings it up when a stack is linked:
  ./sc pm2-broker          run the broker in the foreground (unix socket)
  ./sc pm2-broker-up       start it in the background (nohup + pidfile); self-skips if unlinked/already up
  ./sc pm2-broker-down     stop the backgrounded broker
  ./sc pm2-broker-sock     print the broker's socket path
  ./sc pm2-broker-install  supervise via a systemd --user unit (survives logout/reboot)
  ./sc pm2-broker-uninstall remove the systemd unit

  db broker (run on the HOST — read-only diagnostic reads of the fork's LIVE app
  DB for a sandboxed shell, without handing it a DSN or a route. Shells out to
  psql host-side; SELECT-only + table allowlist + row cap; the DSN must be a
  read-only role. One-time: ./sc db-init. See .super-coder/docs/db-broker.md.
  ./sc db-init             add the "db" block to instance.json + print host setup steps
  ./sc db-broker           run the broker in the foreground (unix socket)
  ./sc db-broker-up        start it in the background (nohup + pidfile); self-skips if unlinked/already up
  ./sc db-broker-down      stop the backgrounded broker
  ./sc db-broker-sock      print the broker's socket path
  ./sc db-broker-install   supervise via a systemd --user unit (survives logout/reboot)
  ./sc db-broker-uninstall remove the systemd unit

  Persist (HOST-side — reboot-proof the fork in one verb; #359): installs the
  systemd --user unit for every daemon that applies here (vm/ts/pm2/db brokers
  when linked), enables linger, skips the rest with a reason. Idempotent:
  ./sc persist             install + enable --now every applicable unit

  Postgres sidecar (app-only; docker container on SC_NET, data in a named volume).
  For developing/testing the fork's APP against real Postgres in the sandbox — the
  engine DB stays SQLite. One-time: ./sc pg-init (adds "pg" to instance.json).
  `launch` starts it + forwards DATABASE_URL (override with SC_DATABASE_URL); `down` stops it:
  ./sc pg-init             add the "pg" key to instance.json (enables the sidecar)
  ./sc pg-up               start the postgres:17 container; self-skips if unconfigured/already up
  ./sc pg-down             stop + remove the container (data volume retained)
                             (recreate via pg-down→pg-up to change --shm-size / SC_PG_SHM)

  ./sc verify              rebuild + flat render + render-only boot (headless proof)
  ./sc health              curl the review layer's /api/health
  ./sc ports               show this fork's derived port
  ./sc url                 print this fork's review GUI + dev-server URLs (derived, never a fixed 8800)
                             — the recall path when the boot summary has scrolled away (subfloor url)
  ./sc preview             live-preview every dev shell's worktree UI on one port,
                             routed by subdomain (http://<shortname>.localhost:<dev_port>/)
  ./sc clean-db            remove the rebuilt .db (text serializations untouched)
