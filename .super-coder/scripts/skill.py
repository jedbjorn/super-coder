"""`./sc skill` — the explicit write surface for the skill catalogue (#237).

Skill grants used to live only as raw SQL blocks, where a grant whose skill
name didn't resolve was a SILENT no-op (`INSERT ... SELECT` over zero rows,
#253). This surface makes the
lifecycle first-class and loud: unknown skill or shell names are hard
errors, engine skills refuse `rm` (the seed would just resurrect them),
and every supported mutation persists the local snapshot and projections.
Naming a standard shell targets its shared flavor pack; naming a Bespoke shell
targets only that shell.

Launched shells reach this module through two lanes. A local Admin seat opens
the DB directly and enforces `require_planner` before `put`. A launched shell
(including the Planner, whose restricted execution view masks the private
engine-state root) is detected by a failed direct-DB open and rerouted
through authenticated `/_sc/skills/*` routes on the review API, which runs
the same validation and persistence ladder server-side. Both lanes share
`cmd_*_api` and the `_*_spec` helpers, and every verb rides the fallback —
including retire/unretire, whose retire list is instance-local state the API
host writes exactly as the local CLI would. Nothing here resolves the private
DB path at import time: that resolution is what fails on a restricted seat,
so it happens inside `connect()` where the fallback can catch it (#1493).

Engine catalogue rows are authored as assets + `./sc seed-skills`. Fork-local
rows are DB-canonical and enter through `put --file`; the input file remains a
draft and is never copied into managed engine assets.

ENGINE skills can't be `rm`'d (the seed resurrects them on every update) —
they retire via the fork retire list instead (#238): `retire` writes the
name to `.sc-state/skills_retired.json` (tracked, fork-owned — commit it)
and flips the row to is_deleted=1, which every surface already filters on.
The list is re-applied after every seed sync/heal/rebuild, so it rides
`./sc update` the same way flavor overlays do. Grant rows stay in place
(inert) so `unretire` restores who-had-what.

Usage:
    ./sc skill list                        catalogue: origin, common, grants
    ./sc skill put --file <SKILL.md>       create/update a DB-canonical LOCAL skill
    ./sc skill grant  <name> <shell>...    grant via shell reference (flavor/Bespoke)
    ./sc skill revoke <name> <shell>...    revoke via shell reference
    ./sc skill rm     <name>               soft-delete a LOCAL skill + revoke all grants
    ./sc skill retire   <name>             retire an ENGINE skill fork-wide (durable)
    ./sc skill unretire <name>             restore a retired engine skill (+ its grants)
