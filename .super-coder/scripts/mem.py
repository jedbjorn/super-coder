"""sc mem — the engine memory surface, over the API. No direct DB. No fallback.

A shell reads and writes its own identity/memory through the engine HTTP API
(`/_sc/mem/*`) and nothing else. There is no `sqlite3` path here: a raw query on
a fork is a foot-gun (the engine DB and a product DB share table names, and
0-byte stub files get silently created into real tables), and a silent direct-DB
fallback let a shell believe a write went through the API when it hadn't. So
every command calls the API and only the API — if the API isn't wired, it fails
loud.

Identity is the token, both ways:
  • run.py injects `SC_API_TOKEN` (the shell's api_key) + `SC_API_BASE` at boot;
  • the server middleware resolves that token → shell_id and scopes every
    operation to it.
So the client passes NO identity — no `--shell`, no DB path. The shell cannot
act as another shell (identity isn't a spoofable argument; it's the secret
token). The one place a *recipient* is named is `message send <to>` — that
addresses someone else's inbox; the sender is always the token.

An owner-only runtime artifact may be passed through `SC_MEM_CREDENTIAL_FILE`;
this client validates and reads that file locally instead of accepting identity
as a command argument.

Host Admin discovery (spec doc #30 req 11): a host Admin seat booted outside
run.py has neither var. When BOTH are absent, `sc mem` may adopt the unique
owner-only runtime credential the supervised API provisions per Admin shell
(`.super-coder/run/mem/<shortname>.json`, mode 0600) — `SC_MEM_AS=<shortname>`
selects one when several exist; ambiguity, a symlinked or otherwise insecure
artifact, and a stale (rotated) token all refuse with the supported action.
Discovery still calls the API; it is never a direct-DB path.

Run from the repo root, like every engine command:

    ./sc mem which                                 # confirm the memory API is reachable + which shell this session resolves as

Writes retry on engine-DB contention (#331): the server answers 503 when the
shared DB is busy (nothing committed) and every method retries it; ambiguous
timeouts are retried only where safe — GET/PATCH, plus sends (idempotent via a
per-invocation dedupe_key, so a retry can never write a duplicate, #333).
