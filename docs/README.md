# subfloor — Docs

[![Open in md-converter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-md--converter-6b46c1?style=flat-square)](https://md-converter.designs-os.com/?url=https://github.com/jedbjorn/subfloor/blob/main/docs/README.md)

One page, eleven sections — each `##` heading renders as a tab in md-converter;
on GitHub this reads as one long page with the same anchors.

## Architecture

### A harness overlay

A coding harness ships the **loop** — model, tools, context window — and
forgets everything else between sessions. subfloor is a **harness
overlay**: it supplies the properties a harness doesn't keep, and injects
every one of them through an extension point the harness itself already
ships — nothing patched, nothing forked:

| Property | Ours | Enters the harness via |
|---|---|---|
| **Boot context** | identity · memory · laws · current state | the boot doc it reads natively (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) |
| **Native tooling** | the `./sc` CLI — `mem` · jobs · models · brokers | the shell it already executes commands in |
| **Skills** | DB-canonical catalogue, per-shell grants | the skill dirs it already discovers |
| **Guardrails** | branch-guard · sandbox · worktrees | its own hook / plugin seams + the environment it boots into |
| **Coordination** | messages · detached jobs · headless boots | its headless mode (`claude -p` · `codex exec` · `opencode run` · `kimi -p`) |

The overlay makes the harness you rent behave like it has all of this built
in — without touching its loop. Think **distro over kernel**: the kernel (the
harness) runs the process; the distro (subfloor) gives it users, packages,
init, and permissions. Four harnesses, one overlay, zero forks of anyone's
loop — that is what harness-agnostic means in practice, and it's why a fork
is cheap: same overlay, whichever kernel you rent underneath.

This repo is also **dogfood**: subfloor maintains subfloor. Its own
`.super-coder/` engine manages the maintainer shell that builds it.

### Layout

```
.super-coder/         the engine — a gitignored, materialized DEPENDENCY in a
                      fork (see .super-coder/README.md); tracked only in this
                      source repo, where the engine IS the project
.sc-state/            fork-owned: tracked engine.ref (the upstream SHA pin)
                      + ignored local/ (DB snapshot, map, flat renders)
.claude/skills/       per-shell skills, rendered at boot — gitignored
.sc-worktrees/        one git worktree per shell — gitignored (admin excepted;
                      see "How shells share one repo")
CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md boot artifact — gitignored, rebuilt at launch
```

A fork's git surfaces show **only its project** — the engine is a dependency,
not committed source, exactly like `node_modules/`. Instance identity, memory,
maps, and renders stay local. A fresh clone is a new instance; it does not clone
another installation's shells or memory.

## Install

### Quick start

> [!class2]
> **UI** Shells (your landing tab) · **Shells** your starting team — 2×planner · 4×dev · 2×reviewer · admin · cartographer

**Preparation**

One-time Linux host setup — get this right and the rest is `./sc install`.
subfloor runs the harness in a **docker sandbox**; the installer bootstraps
everything else. Arch Linux (including CachyOS) and Ubuntu LTS are the
supported hosts. The Linux host needs a container engine, a few base tools, and
one signed-in coding harness.

| Need | Linux host |
|---|---|
| **Container engine** | Install Docker with your distribution's package tooling. For example, Arch uses `sudo pacman -S docker`; rootless setup is `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install && systemctl --user enable --now docker`. |
| **Base tools** | Install Git, curl, Python, and SQLite with your distribution's package tooling. Python 3.14.x with `sqlite3` is required. |
| **Harness CLI** | `./sc install` installs `claude` · `opencode` · `codex` · `vibe` · `kimi` through their native installers. Repair a harness with its documented Linux installer if needed. |
| **Harness account** | Have a plan for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Vibe, or Kimi Code; sign in once in Linux. |

> [!class4]
> **The bar: Linux, Python 3.14.x with `sqlite3`, a reachable docker daemon, and a harness CLI on PATH.** `./sc doctor` reports the selected absolute interpreter, version, SQLite result, docker mode (rootless / rootful), and the exact next command. `SC_PYTHON`, when non-empty, selects the exact interpreter. No docker at all? Install with `./sc install --runtime host`: the **host runtime** runs the review server as a supervised host process (nohup + pidfile under `.super-coder/run/`) and boots shells directly on the host, and every lifecycle verb follows it — `launch`, `enter`, `down`, `restart`, `logs`, `update-harnesses`, `doctor`, and `update` (which stops and relaunches the host server around DB maintenance). The selection is the `runtime` key in `.super-coder/instance.json`; `./sc runtime host|sandbox` switches it later. `./sc serve` + `./sc boot` remain the bare primitives under either runtime.

On macOS or Windows, create a Linux VM, install these prerequisites in the
guest, and keep the checkout on guest-owned storage when practical. Host-shared
storage may work but is not certified.

**Install & launch**

With the prerequisites in place, drop subfloor into an existing git repo and
boot a shell:

```bash
cd your-repo                                                  # an existing git repo

# 1. Pull in the engine + entry script (files only, main branch only, no history merge):
git remote add -t main super-coder https://github.com/jedbjorn/subfloor.git
git fetch super-coder
git checkout super-coder/main -- .super-coder sc

# 2. Bootstrap the fork — installs harness CLIs, builds the DB, seeds your starting team:
./sc install                    # add --runtime host to run without docker (see the bar above)

# 3. Commit the install before creating shell worktrees:
git add -A && git commit --no-verify -m "chore: install subfloor"

# 4. Launch through the subfloor command (open a new terminal first, or `source ~/.bashrc`, so the function the installer just wrote is defined):
subfloor launch

# 5. Sign in to your harness once, in Linux (not inside the sandbox), then enter:
claude                          # or:  opencode auth login  ·  codex login  ·  vibe --setup  ·  kimi login
subfloor enter
```

That's the happy path. Each step is covered in depth below — installer internals,
harness sign-in, the docker modes, and the localhost review GUI. For the full
arc from a fresh repo through ship-and-loop, see [*The loop*](#the-loop).

Installation intentionally activates the universal branch guard before step 5.
That one operator-owned bootstrap commit is a deliberate commit to the
repository's default branch, so its copy-paste command uses `--no-verify`.
Later direct operator commits on a protected default branch require the same
deliberate bypass. Shell and feature work remains branch-first.

### Installer internals

> [!class2]
> **UI** Shells · Scripts · **Shells** seeds the starting team — 2×planner · 4×dev · 2×reviewer · admin · cartographer

subfloor installs **alongside** your code — it renders to `_sc` dirs, so it
never collides with your repo's own `/docs`, `/specs`, or skills. A fork
inherits the **system** (schema + the skill catalogue + the render chain), never
subfloor's own memory or roadmap.

> [!class4]
> **Requirements: Python 3.14.x with `sqlite3`, plus `docker`.** The default run mode is a sandbox container, so the harness's "allow everything" is safe — the kernel is the boundary, and the container sees only this repo + your harness creds. The image bakes the rest: `python3`, `sqlite3`, `git`, `curl`, and the harness CLIs. No docker? The `./sc serve` + `./sc boot` primitives run on the host with the selected Python 3.14.x interpreter, `sqlite3`, and a harness on `PATH`. Set `SC_PYTHON` to select that interpreter explicitly.

**Docker mode — rootless is the default.** `./sc doctor` checks your docker.
Both modes work (the launcher's `duser()` adapts), and **rootless is the chosen
default: zero setup, same function.** Under rootless the sandbox runs the
container as root, which maps to *you*, so repo writes come out owned by you —
no phantom-uid problem (verified). Its only wart: `claude` runs as root inside,
so its `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag is blocked — the sandbox replaces
the need for it. **Rootful is optional**, purely to drop that wart (1:1
bind-mounts, harness runs as a normal user); it costs a one-time sudo + re-login.

**Setup is one-time per machine (and rootless needs none).** `./sc launch` only
checks the daemon is reachable and points you here if not — it never does setup.

- **Rootless (default) — nothing to do.** If rootless docker runs as your user,
  `./sc launch` works as-is.
- **Rootful (optional upgrade).** Needs sudo + a re-login (a new `docker` group
  only applies to a fresh session — which is exactly why it can't fold into
  `launch`):

  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER            # 1. join the docker group
  sudo systemctl enable --now docker.socket # 2. start the system daemon
  # 3. LOG OUT and back in (the group only applies to a new session)
  docker context use default                # 4. point the CLI at the system daemon
  systemctl --user disable --now docker.service  # 5. optional: stop rootless
  ./sc doctor                               # verify → "docker ✓ rootful"
  ```

The commands are the five steps in the Quick start above — pull the engine in
via git (no history merge; subfloor never touches your repo's own build
files), `./sc install`, sign in, launch, commit.

`./sc install` does the rest: checks requirements, **installs the harness CLIs**
(`claude` + `opencode` + `codex` + `vibe` + `kimi`, via their official native installers — no
npm — if any are missing; `--skip-harness-install` to detect only), wires your `.gitignore`,
**makes the engine a gitignored dependency** (`git rm -r --cached .super-coder` —
files stay on disk; pins its upstream SHA in `.sc-state/engine.ref`), **strips
subfloor's own per-instance content** (a fork inherits the *system* — schema +
skill catalogue + render chain — never the memory or roadmap), builds the system
DB, seeds your fork's **starting team** (your user + a planner-flavor *primary*
carrying the CC Lineage Seed and its own genesis seed, plus a second `planner`,
four `dev`, two `reviewer` shells, the `admin` that owns `main`, and the singleton
**Cartographer** repo-map owner), and renders. So after install
your git surfaces show only your project — the engine no longer appears in
`git status`. It refuses to run in the subfloor source repo or on an
already-installed fork (guarding against content loss).

Interactive by default (prompts for your **primary** shell's name/role/mandate —
the rest of the team is auto-named); pass flags to script it. `--flavor` picks
which roster slot is your primary (default `planner`):

```bash
python3 .super-coder/scripts/install.py \
    --username Jed --name Lead --shortname lead \
    --role "Planning lead" --mandate "Scope and steer the work in this repo."
```

After `./sc enter` you're talking to the shell, working your repo. Author
memory, roadmap, and specs into the DB; `./sc snapshot` (+ `./sc render`)
serializes back to the text git tracks.

### Harness sign-in

> [!class2]
> **UI** — host auth, no GUI · **Shells** any (the harness is a per-launch pick)

The harnesses are just CLIs — `./sc install` (and `./sc update`, `./sc
ensure-harness`) install the binaries, but you authenticate each **once, on the
host**, with your own account/subscription:

```bash
claude                      # Claude Code — prompts to sign in on first run
opencode auth login         # OpenCode
codex login                 # Codex (OpenAI / ChatGPT account)
vibe --setup                # Mistral Vibe — stores the API key (or export MISTRAL_API_KEY)
kimi login                  # Kimi Code — device-code OAuth against your Kimi membership
```

`./sc launch` bind-mounts each harness's credential dir into the sandbox
(`~/.claude` + `~/.claude.json`, `~/.config/opencode` + `~/.local/share/opencode`,
`~/.codex`, `~/.vibe`, `~/.kimi-code`), so host auth flows straight into the
container — **you never sign in inside the sandbox.** Authenticate on the host,
then `./sc enter`.

> [!class4]
> **Sign in on the host, not inside the sandbox.** OAuth logins spin up a localhost callback server (Codex uses `:1455`). Run the login on the **host** so your browser's callback reaches it — from *inside* the sandbox that port isn't published, so the browser gets `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.

> [!class2]
> **Vibe creds.** `vibe --setup` stores your key under `~/.vibe`, which the sandbox now mounts — so Vibe works inside the container like the others. Prefer the env-var path? `export MISTRAL_API_KEY` on the host before `./sc launch` and it's forwarded in (only when set). Re-run `./sc launch` after first authenticating, so the mount picks up `~/.vibe`.

> [!class2]
> **Kimi creds.** `kimi login` (device-code OAuth) stores its state under `~/.kimi-code`, which the sandbox mounts — host auth flows in. Note kimi does **not** read keys from shell env vars (`export KIMI_API_KEY=…` does nothing); provider keys live in `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`. Re-run `./sc launch` after first authenticating, so the mount picks it up.

> [!class2]
> **OpenCode is the exception.** Its `opencode auth login` for **API-key** providers is a paste-the-key prompt, not an OAuth callback, so it works at **either level** — host or inside the container (`./sc enter`). Because `~/.config/opencode` + `~/.local/share/opencode` are bind-mounted read-write, a key entered on either side lands in the same `auth.json`. (OAuth-based OpenCode providers still follow the host rule above.)

A note on Codex models: driven by a **ChatGPT account** (not an API key), Codex
exposes the `gpt-5.6` line (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`) and `gpt-5.5` — the
flavor defaults are set from those. Plain API-only ids return a 400 on a
ChatGPT account.

## The loop

> [!class2]
> **UI** Roadmap → Flags → Docs → Worktrees → Map · **Shells** cartographer · planner · dev · reviewer · admin

The everyday cycle a fork runs once it's installed. Each step is owned by a
**shell flavor** (its flavor also sets its model defaults — see *Harnesses &
models*). You move between flavors with `./sc enter-<shortname>`.

Guidance is boot-first. Everything a shell does in most sessions — memory
writes, the inbox, flags, version control, orientation — lives in the boot
artifact every shell reads at launch; each flavor's own procedure (the dev's
spec loop and testing posture, the reviewer's review steps, the planner's spec
contract, the admin's root-checkout rules, the cartographer's map worklists)
lives in its system prompt. Skills hold only work triggered by an event, a
period, a request, or an armed Sprint. Every flavor carries the common kit —
`curate`, `issue_reporting`, and `web_search` — so only the flavor-specific
skills are called out below.

Global skills have four purposes: explain Subfloor, identify a supplied tool,
identify a supplied testing environment, or define a core Subfloor process.
General planning, coding, API, testing, database, deployment, VM, and host
method stays model work. A Planner records real fork-specific capabilities as
DB-canonical local skills through `fork_skill_design`; update and rebuild
preserve those bodies and grants.

Each flavor's flavor-specific skills (on top of that common kit) and the steps
it owns:

| Flavor | Flavor skills | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **cartographer** | `git` | map · re-map |
| **planner** | `onboard` · `flag_sweep` · `fork_skill_design` · `dev_kit` · `themed_markdown` · `git` · `sprint_protocol` · `sprint_prep` · `sprint_pln` | spec doc · local capability design · freeze + docs |
| **dev** | `git` · `redline_review` · `harness_readiness` · `sprint_protocol` · `sprint_dev` | break into tasks · implement · patch + test |
| **reviewer** | `git` · `redline_review` · `sprint_protocol` · `sprint_rev` | review |
| **admin** | `git_cleanup` · `engine_database` · `engine_migrations` · `self_update` · `snapshot` | engine lifecycle · verify-clean |
| **devops** | `git` · `themed_markdown` | tracked runtime changes; fork-local host/deploy tools |

1. **Install** — `./sc install` seeds your **starting team**: two `planner`
   (one is your primary), four `dev`, two `reviewer` shells, the `admin` that owns
   `main` + the engine, and the singleton `cartographer`.
   *(admin · `self_update`, `engine_migrations` · UI: Shells)*
2. **Map the repo** — the cartographer configures the index once with
   `./sc map-setup`, then `./sc map` builds it; git hooks re-map on every pull.
   It's infrastructure working shells *read* through `sc map-schema` and
   `sc map-sql`, as their boot's ORIENTATION section describes.
   *(cartographer · its system prompt · UI: Map)*
3. **Spec it** — the **planner** authors a spec document against a roadmap
   feature — viability, blockers, the done-condition — under the spec contract
   in its system prompt, formatted per `themed_markdown`.
   *(planner · system prompt, `themed_markdown` · UI: Roadmap)*
4. **Switch to dev** — `./sc enter-dev` boots the **dev** shell into its own git
   worktree on `shell/dev`, a base pinned to `origin/main`. A first boot shows
   FIRST RUN: read the map, read yourself, skim the plan, set `current_state`,
   `sc mem oriented`. *(dev · boot · UI: Shells)*
5. **Break it into tasks** — dev reads the spec and follows SPEC EXECUTION in
   its system prompt to decompose it into `spec_tasks` (Preparation → steps →
   Verification), then works one task per session. `current_state` ("last /
   next task") lets sessions resume cleanly. *(dev · system prompt · UI: Roadmap)*
6. **Implement** — within each task, dev cuts a feature branch off `shell/dev`,
   writes code, schema, and tests, then uses the exact `## DEV TOOLS` boot
   inventory to run the fork's declared checks.
   *(dev · ambient DEV TOOLS, `redline_review` · UI: Shells)*
7. **Send to review** — dev pushes and opens a PR (boot VERSION CONTROL:
   branch → commit → push → **PR → stop**; commits carry the shell's trailer
   automatically), then messages the reviewer with `sc mem message send`.
   *(dev · boot · UI: Flags)*
8. **Review, send back** — the **reviewer** reads the diff against the spec
   through the lenses in its system prompt, opens flags for merge blockers, and
   sends the FnB-approved handoff back to dev.
   *(reviewer · system prompt, ambient DEV TOOLS · UI: Flags)*
9. **Patch + test** — dev addresses the flags, re-runs `./sc test`, and
   re-pushes; the thread closes when it's clean and dev closes the flags its
   work cleared. *(dev · ambient DEV TOOLS · UI: Flags)*
10. **Operator merges** — merging is the FnB's gate in one of two forms: an
    explicit directive naming the PR, or the grant recorded when a Sprint is
    armed, which the engine checks live before the shell merges. On dev's next
    boot the launcher auto-syncs the base onto `origin/main` and prunes the
    merged branch. *(operator gate; no shell skill · UI: Worktrees)*
11. **Freeze spec + write docs** — on ship, dev flips the feature to `shipped`
    and opens a docs-pending flag; the planner freezes the spec (`frozen=1`,
    immutable; the next stage opens a fresh `seq`) and writes the feature doc
    from the shipped code. `snapshot` + `./sc render` write read-only local
    renders. *(planner · system prompt; admin · `snapshot` · UI: Docs)*
12. **Verify git trees clean** — the admin's `git_cleanup` triages every worktree
    (clean trees, prunable merged branches, preserved work); `./sc render-check`
    (local `_sc` must match the DB render) and `./sc verify` (rebuild +
    headless boot) are the operator-run proofs.
    *(admin · `git_cleanup`, `snapshot` · UI: Worktrees)*
13. **Re-map** — the cartographer re-runs (auto on pull, or `./sc map`) so the
    index reflects the new shape — and the loop turns to the next feature.
    *(cartographer · system prompt · UI: Map)*

## Harnesses & models

> [!class2]
> **UI** Shells (flavor model defaults) · **Shells** all five flavors

### Prefer a subscription plan over a raw API key

Agentic coding burns **huge** token volume — multi-step loops, large context,
constant re-reads. Metered per-token API billing scales with every one of those
tokens and gets expensive fast. A flat **subscription plan** is generally far
cheaper *and* predictable for this workload, so we recommend running each harness
against its plan rather than its pay-as-you-go API:

| Harness | Provider | Recommended plan |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic | [Claude Pro / Max](https://claude.com/pricing) |
| **Codex** | OpenAI | [ChatGPT Plus / Pro](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/) |
| **Vibe** | Mistral | [Mistral plans](https://mistral.ai/pricing) |
| **Kimi Code** | Moonshot AI | [Kimi memberships (Moderato / Allegretto / …)](https://www.kimi.com/help/membership/membership-pricing) |
| **OpenCode** → open-weights | Ollama | [Ollama Cloud (or run local, free)](https://ollama.com/) |

Codex exists for exactly this reason — a ChatGPT account bills **flat, with no
per-token metering**. OpenCode with a raw API key stays the **metered catch-all**:
reach for it when you need a model no plan covers, accepting per-token cost. Ollama
goes one further — open-weights models you can run **locally for free** on your own
hardware, or on Ollama Cloud's plan.

### Why each role defaults to the model it does

Every shell has a **flavor** (its role); each flavor ships an advisory model
default per harness (the `flavor_defaults` table — the picker pre-selects it;
`--harness` / `-m` / the picker override). The doctrine:

| Flavor | Job | Codex | Claude | OpenCode (open-weights) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **planner** | architecture, plans | `gpt-5.5` | `fable` ★ | `deepseek-v4-pro` |
| **reviewer** | adversarial review | `gpt-5.5` | `fable` ★ | `glm-5.2` |
| **dev** | write the code | `gpt-5.6-sol` ★ | `opus` | `qwen3-coder-next` |
| **cartographer** | map the repo | `gpt-5.6-terra` ★ | `sonnet` | `glm-5.2` |
| **admin** | own the substrate, maintain `main` | `gpt-5.5` | `opus` ★ | `deepseek-v4-pro` |

★ = the harness the picker pre-selects for that flavor.

The logic — defaults are set from observed model/flavor outcomes across the
fleet, re-fit as the evidence moves, plus three standing rules:

- **Bookends premium.** Planner and reviewer are *low-volume, high-leverage
  reasoning* — one good plan or one sharp review pays for the premium model
  (`fable` on both). Dev and cartographer are the volume roles; telemetry
  currently favors the `gpt-5.6` line there (`sol` writing code, `terra`
  mapping), which also keeps the bulk volume on the flat-billed ChatGPT plan.
- **Reviewer runs a different lineage than the code it reviews**, so it isn't
  blind to the same mistakes the authoring model made — adversarial
  *diversity*, not a second opinion from the same brain. With devs on GPT and
  review on Claude, the current fit preserves this.
- **Three lineages, always.** Every flavor offers Codex (OpenAI), Claude
  (Anthropic), and OpenCode (open-weights via Ollama Cloud) — pick any provider for
  any role at launch. The OpenCode column is constrained to **MIT- or
  Apache-licensed** weights only (e.g. DeepSeek V4, GLM-5.2, Qwen3-Coder, gpt-oss);
  Modified-MIT / unresolved-license models (Kimi, MiniMax) are excluded even when
  available on the provider.
- **Admin decisions carry real risk** (a wrong rollback is data loss), so the
  one shell that maintains `main` (see [*Shells & worktrees*](#shells--worktrees))
  defaults premium — currently `opus` on Claude.

> [!class2]
> **Vibe and Kimi Code sit outside this matrix.** Neither takes a model from the launch seam. Vibe selects its own via `active_model` in `~/.vibe/config.toml` (`vibe --setup`) or `VIBE_ACTIVE_MODEL`, and takes no headless boot. Kimi Code selects via `default_model` in `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` (its `-m` wants a user-local alias, not a portable model id) — it *does* boot headless (`kimi -p`), on that configured default (`./sc run` covers claude · codex · opencode · kimi).

### Headless model routing

`flavor_defaults` and the picker cover interactive boots. Generic headless
launches have no picker, so resolve the exact local route before automation:

```bash
./sc models refresh
./sc models list <harness>
./sc models resolve <harness> <selector> --shell <shortname>
./sc run <shortname> --harness <harness> -m <selector> -p "<bounded task>"
```

Refresh reads each installed harness's local catalogue. Resolve refuses
advisory-only models, unsupported headless adapters, and effort levels the
adapter cannot apply exactly. A failed refresh retains the last known routes as
stale evidence instead of silently erasing them. Route records are local
machine/account state and are not serialized into content snapshots.

### Keeping harnesses (and therefore models) current

A new model arrives in a new harness **CLI release** — so a shell can only reach
the models its CLI knows about. The CLIs are image-owned (harness state homes
are mounted, but their executables must never resolve from the host: a
foreign-ABI binary is fatal in a Linux container, and vibe's entry point carries
an absolute shebang into a host interpreter), and docker caches those layers
indefinitely.
`SC_HARNESS_EPOCH` is their cache key. A normal restart gives it a unique value
and reinstalls every harness at latest before replacing the running sandbox.

```
./sc harness-status      # what the sandbox actually runs + is a rebuild owed
./sc restart             # refresh harnesses, build safely, then bounce
./sc restart --no-build  # deliberately reuse the current image
```

If a model that exists is not offered to a shell, start there — it is nearly

## Shells & worktrees

> [!class2]
> **UI** Shells · Worktrees · **Shells** all flavors; admin is the only one on `main`

A fork boots a **whole team** out of the box — `planner` · 2×`dev` · `reviewer`
· `admin` · `cartographer` — and you add or retire shells from the GUI as
needed. They all work the same repo without clobbering each other:

- **Every shell boots into its own git worktree** at
  `.sc-worktrees/<shortname>/` on branch `shell/<shortname>` — parallel shells
  never share a cwd. The branch is a **moving base pinned to `origin/main`**,
  not a content branch: shells cut feature branches from it, push, and open
  PRs. Merging stays the operator's gate.
- **The launcher keeps bases fresh.** Every boot fetches and auto-syncs the
  worktree onto `origin/main` — but only when provably nothing can be lost
  (on the base branch, clean tree, no local-only commits). Anything local
  blocks the sync and is surfaced in the boot doc instead, so the shell asks
  you before any work is touched.
- **A branch-guard blocks work on `main`** in every harness — pre-tool hooks
  (Claude Code, Codex), an OpenCode plugin, and a git pre-commit backstop, all
  one shared script. Under Claude Code it also inspects the **edit's target
  path**, so a shell editing the stale repo-root checkout from inside its
  worktree is blocked (and an out-of-worktree edit to a feature branch warns).
- **The admin shell is the one exception.** It boots in the **repo root** on
  `main` and maintains it directly — engine updates, rollbacks, migrations,
  applying approved patches, fork-local skills. The branch-guard exempts it
  (and only it). Working shells consume the substrate; admin owns the floor.
- **Reviewing a shell's UI work:** worktree edits never show on your main dev
  server. `./sc preview` serves every shell worktree's UI live (HMR) on the
  fork's dev port, routed by subdomain — `http://<shortname>.localhost:<port>/`
  — and the post-commit hook prints the shell's URL after each commit.

## Browser conversations

> [!class2]
> **UI** Chats · **Modes** Chat and Diff · **Shells** any ordinary shell

The **Chats** tab hosts durable normal conversations. Select an available shell,
choose a supported harness and model, and create a chat without opening a
terminal. Each accepted message is stored before dispatch, queued in order, and
resumed against the exact harness-native session recorded for that conversation.

A shell has at most one open browser conversation. Browser and CLI ownership
are mutually exclusive: a CLI launch refuses while browser chat is open, and a
browser conversation refuses while a CLI session owns the shell. **Close** is
the explicit browser-to-CLI handoff.

### Chat lifecycle

- **New chat** creates a distinct durable conversation and closes only an idle,
  waiting, or failed prior chat for that shell.
- Messages submitted during an active turn remain ordered in the queue; they do
  not interrupt the running turn.
- **Stop** interrupts only the active turn and preserves queued follow-ups.
- **Close** cancels queued work, requests interruption when needed, waits for
  terminal proof, and then releases the shell.
- Closed conversations remain readable history. Stars pin important chats
  without changing their lifecycle.
- Browser refresh resumes from a bounded transcript snapshot plus the live event
  cursor; the harness transcript is evidence, never the message queue.

The broker owns dispatch and crash recovery. It leases an outbox item, creates
one run, starts or exactly resumes the harness session, stores normalized
events, and commits the terminal result before releasing the lease. Startup and
lease-expiry scans are bounded recovery, not scheduled work discovery.

### Chat and Diff

**Chat** renders user prompts, assistant output, durable activity, queue state,
and recovery controls. Large histories load in bounded pages and transcript
snapshots; omitted display history remains durable.

**Diff** is a read-only projection of the same conversation's live worktree,
branch, or pull request. Switching to Diff does not stop the run or open a
second conversation. The view preserves review after local branch cleanup by
using the stored Git target and canonical merged-PR patch when available.

The browser receives normalized conversation and Git-review resources only. It
never receives harness credentials or mutates a harness transcript directly.

## Messages, jobs & headless launch

> [!class2]
> **UI** Shells · Scripts · **Shells** all flavors

Three generic tools cover work that should not live in one interactive context.

### Shell messages

`./sc mem message` provides durable shell-to-shell mail:

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `shell` | ordinary coordination |
| `task` | a bounded instruction for another shell |
| `result` | completion evidence or a job outcome |

`check` reads unread messages without acknowledging them; `mark-read` clears
one only after it has been acted on. Sends carry a dedupe key, so a timed-out
request can be verified with `sent` before any retry.

### Wakes

A wake delivers a message into a shell's session instead of waiting for its
next boot. Shells are told only what to do with one (read it, act, accept
Sprint work explicitly); the mechanics live here for the operator.

- **Active-chat registry.** The engine tracks at most one active chat per
  shell; zero is legal. The registry is the sole current-chat authority and
  carries the verified pid/start-ticks identity only while a turn runs. Closing
  or rotating a chat unlinks its process. A 60-second reaper verifies process
  identity before interrupt/TERM/KILL escalation, and an inactivity ceiling
  closes silent hung turns so they become reapable.
- **Delivery intent and coalescing.** Every wake message creates durable
  delivery intent. Pending wakes coalesce per receiver, and one wake turn
  drains every undelivered message for that shell. The type resolves at
  delivery: `re-enter` resumes the existing chat at its next boundary; `new`
  opens a fresh chat when the shell has none or its chat is idle and is
  absorbed at the boundary of a live turn; `force-new` is never absorbed — it
  waits for the live turn to end and a quiet gate, then closes the old chat and
  opens a fresh one. Sprint assignments, review requests, and verdicts are
  `force-new`; Planner-bound results, decisions, and PR facts are `re-enter`.
- **PR facts.** Developer-owned PR subscriptions (discovered from the
  worktree's checked-out branch, `sc sprint register-pr` in a lane, or manual
  `sc pr subscribe`) emit self-describing red/green/closed/merged wakes to the
  owning Developer throughout ownership, inside or outside a Sprint; outside an
  armed or paused Sprint, green arrives only as red-to-green recovery. Planner
  and Reviewer receive no PR-event wakes.
- **Coordinate mode.** Closing the Planner chat during an armed Sprint sets
  coordinate mode: idle Planner `re-enter` wakes open fresh ticket chats.
  Pause/resume from the GUI returns to supervise mode; automatic pauses
  preserve the dial.
- **Arming** validates every recorded role harness/model/effort selection
  before publishing work; defaults satisfy the gate.

### Sprint fallbacks (operator)

The normal close is the conformance Reviewer's atomic `record-conformance`;
these surfaces are the operator's explicit fallbacks and follow-ups. Target
identities are engine-derived; never supply a path.

```bash
# bounded evidence packet when the Reviewer cannot compile it (max --limit 200)
./sc sprint compile-report --sprint <id> --limit 50 > shared/sprints/sprint-<n>/evidence.json
# inspect, retry, or adopt post-Sprint cleanup of participant worktrees
./sc sprint cleanup-status --sprint <id>
./sc sprint cleanup --sprint <id> --key <stable-retry-key>
./sc sprint cleanup --sprint <legacy-id> --adopt-legacy --key <stable-adoption-key>
# stop without deleting history (also a Planner action on a Reviewer decision)
./sc sprint abort --sprint <id> --reason <reason> [--outcome <outcome>]
# one disposition per pending follow-up after closure
./sc sprint disposition-followup --sprint <id> --followup <id> --disposition accepted
./sc sprint disposition-followup --sprint <id> --followup <id> --disposition resolved --resolution-file <path>
```

`accepted` acknowledges ship-as-is; `resolved` and `dismissed` require a
bounded resolution file. A cleanup retry key is reused only for the identical
request. The standalone `sc sprint complete` surface is likewise an
operator-directed recovery fallback, never the normal clean close.

### Session-surviving jobs

```bash
./sc job start --label suite --timeout 1800 -- pytest
./sc job list
./sc job status <id>
./sc job tail <id>
./sc job wait <id>
./sc job kill <id>
```

A job is a detached supervised one-shot. It outlives the shell session that
started it, captures bounded output, group-kills on timeout, and posts a
`result` message to the starting shell when it completes. Use it for suites,
builds, and benchmarks that would otherwise die with the harness process.

### Generic headless launch

```bash
./sc models refresh
./sc models resolve <harness> <selector> --shell <shortname>
./sc run <shortname> --harness <harness> -m <selector> -p "<bounded task>"
```

`./sc run` renders the same shell identity and skills as an interactive boot,
executes one non-interactive harness turn, records its archive, and exits.
Model resolution is exact: unsupported aliases, headless adapters, or effort
levels fail before launch. The caller owns the task contract and any follow-up
message; the launcher does not invent workflow or merge authority.

## Update a fork

> [!class2]
> **UI** Scripts (migrate · rebuild) · **Shells** admin

Ship an improvement to subfloor, pull it into each fork — **in place**, with
no loss of memory. The shell updates its own substrate: it pulls the new engine,
applies new migrations under its own feet, and the next boot stands on the new
floor with every row intact. (The shell-facing version of this is the
`self_update` skill — same procedure, framed as the handoff it is.)

```bash
./sc update                     # fetch + materialize the engine, reconcile in place
git add .sc-state/engine.ref sc && git commit --no-verify -m "chore: update subfloor"
```

The update commit is another deliberate operator-owned commit on the protected
default branch. Launched shells still create a feature branch first and are not
given a bypass recipe.

`./sc update` fetches the engine from the `super-coder` remote and
**materializes** it into the gitignored `.super-coder/` dir (the engine is a
dependency — code, schema, migrations, skills; your `.sc-state/`, DB, and
`instance.json` are never touched), **pins** the new upstream SHA in
`.sc-state/engine.ref` (keeping the prior one as `engine.ref.prev`), backs up the
live DB, **applies pending migrations in place** (never a rebuild-from-snapshot —
your unsnapshotted in-session writes survive), syncs the skills catalogue
(id-stable, so grants stay valid), re-grants any new common skills, refreshes the
repo map, re-installs the `subfloor` shell function for bash and fish, and
re-snapshots the live state. Nothing under `.super-coder/` is
committed — you commit only the bumped `.sc-state/engine.ref` and any
deliberately authored project changes. Generated snapshots and `_sc` renders
remain ignored. Then restart the session to boot onto the new floor.

- `./sc update --no-fetch` reconciles against the current working tree (offline /
  dev) — engine + `engine.ref` unchanged. `--branch <name>` to track a non-`main`
  engine branch. `--ref <tag|sha>` pins the materialize to a specific upstream
  version instead of the branch head — hold a fork at a known-good engine and
  move deliberately.
- Missing remote? `git remote add -t main super-coder https://github.com/jedbjorn/subfloor.git`

> [!class4]
> **Local engine edits block the update — never silently overwritten.** The
> materialize is a wholesale overwrite, so the engine keeps a hash manifest
> (written at install and after every materialize) and `./sc update` refuses
> when an engine file was locally modified since — listing the files and the
> real options: revert the edit, **upstream it** (PR subfloor — the strong
> default), `--force` to knowingly discard it, or `./sc eject` to own the
> engine outright (see *Customize a fork vs diverge from it*, next).

### An update that aborts partway — re-run it

An update that fails **after** the materialize step leaves a consistent,
resumable state: `engine.ref` is not advanced, the new engine is fully on disk,
and whatever migrations ran are already recorded in the ledger. **Re-run `./sc
update`.** The second run is dispatched from the on-disk (new) engine, the
materialize is a byte-identical no-op, `migrate` reports nothing pending, and
the run continues from where the first one stopped and advances the pin.

Don't reach for `./sc rollback` here — that is the remedy for a *completed*
update that turned out bad, not for one that stopped halfway.

> [!class4]
> **Why a fix that is already upstream can still bite a fork once.** The
> crossing is driven by the updater you *already have*: `update.py` is loaded
> into memory before the new engine is written over it, so for the rest of that
> run old updater code is reading new engine data. A defect fixed in the updater
> therefore takes effect from the **next** crossing — a fork pinned before the
> fix hits it exactly once, and the re-run is the crossing that clears it. This
> is the same constraint that makes a breaking engine change ship as a two-hop
> floor (a compatibility release first, the real change second). Worked example:
> [#1430](https://github.com/jedbjorn/subfloor/issues/1430), where a pre-fix
> updater validated the new engine's skill-tombstone registry with its own
> older, hyphen-rejecting name pattern and aborted catalogue sync on
> `api-design`.

### Roll back a bad update

```bash
./sc rollback                   # restore the DB + engine together, then reboot
```

`./sc rollback` is a **sound pair-restore**: because engine code is read live and
a migration exists *because new code expects the new schema*, it restores both —
it backs up the current DB first (rollback is itself reversible), restores the DB
from the most recent pre-update backup, and re-materializes the engine at
`.sc-state/engine.ref.prev`. Whole-restore, not a per-step schema reversal; the
only data lost is anything written between the update and the rollback.

> [!class4]
> **The contract:** every schema change *after* a fork exists ships as a `migrations/NNNN_*.sql` file, never an edit to `schema.sql` — the migration ledger is what carries a delta across to an existing fork. Additive where you can make it.

### Retire the make aliases (one-time)

The `make dos-*` aliases are retired in favour of the `subfloor` command. An
existing fork migrates in one update:

1. `make dos-u` (or `./sc update`). The update materializes the new engine and
   installs the `subfloor` function into `~/.bashrc` and
   `~/.config/fish/functions/subfloor.fish`.
2. Open a new terminal, or `source ~/.bashrc`, then run `subfloor help` to
   confirm the command resolves.
3. `subfloor make-cleanup` — removes the `-include .super-coder/aliases.mk`
   line the installer added to your `Makefile` (the `Makefile` itself is
   deleted only when the installer wrote it), and removes the retired
   `.super-coder/aliases.mk`. `--dry-run` previews without writing.
4. Commit the update:

```bash
git add -u && git add .sc-state/engine.ref sc && git commit --no-verify -m "chore: update subfloor"
```

Until step 3 runs, the old aliases keep working from the lingering file; after
it, `make dos-*` is gone and `subfloor <verb>` is the only surface. `./sc alias`
re-installs the function on another machine or after a shell-config reset.

### Customize a fork vs diverge from it

> [!class2]
> **UI** — a policy, not a tab · **Shells** admin (owns the engine boundary)

The engine/fork boundary draws a clean decision rule for the question every
fork operator eventually asks: *"the engine doesn't do what I need — now what?"*

**Customize (the default — track upstream forever).** As long as what you need
fits the **fork-owned extension points**, you never touch engine files, and
`./sc update` keeps delivering fixes, migrations, and new skills indefinitely:

| Extension point | What it carries |
|---|---|
| **Local skills** | Planner-authored capability/process descriptions via `sc skill put` — DB-canonical, serialized in `content.sql`, explicitly granted, and preserved byte-for-byte across update/rebuild |
| **Flavor overlays** | `.sc-state/flavors/<flavor>.json` — fork identity text (`role`, `mandate`, `focus`, `abbr`); skill assignments use `sc skill grant/revoke` instead |
| **Skill retire list** | `.sc-state/skills_retired.json` (written by `./sc skill retire <name>`) — engine skills this fork has taken out of service, e.g. ones superseded by a fork-local skill. Retired skills leave every surface (boot doc, renders, grants) on ALL shells and stay retired across updates; `unretire` restores them, grants intact |
| **`instance.json`** | Per-fork config: ports, harness default, the `pg` / `vm` / `ts` opt-in blocks |
| **`.sc-state/`** | Your memory (content.sql), map tuning, engine pin — the fork's one tracked artifact |
| **Per-shell identity** | `current_state`, connections, decisions, seed — all DB rows, all yours |
| **Your project** | Everything outside `.super-coder/` — the engine never touches it |

**Upstream (when the extension points don't reach).** Need an actual engine
change? **PR it to subfloor first.** If one fork needs it, the next fork
probably does too — that's how the engine grows (dos-arch is exactly this
proving-ground loop). Your fork then picks the change up through a normal
`./sc update`, still on the lifeline.

**Diverge (`./sc eject` — the one-way door).** Only when the change is
genuinely yours and upstream would rightly not take it. Eject flips the model:
`.super-coder/` becomes **fork source** — un-gitignored, committed, edited like
any other code — and the upstream lifeline is cut for good:

```linear
Extension points fit :::class3 -> Upstream the change :::class1 -> Eject :::class4
```

```bash
./sc eject          # interactive warning + typed confirmation, then stages the flip
```

What it does: drops the `/.super-coder/` gitignore rule (engine runtime files —
DB, `instance.json`, `run/`, `logs/` — stay ignored), deletes the engine pin
(`engine.ref`), writes a `.sc-state/ejected` marker recording the SHA you
diverged at, removes the `super-coder` remote (`--keep-remote` to keep it for
reference), and stages everything. **Committing stays yours** — review the diff
first. After eject, `./sc update` and `./sc rollback` refuse (the marker);
launch, enter, snapshot, render, and the GUI work unchanged.

> [!class4]
> **What you give up, permanently:** upstream fixes, schema migrations, and new
> catalogue skills stop flowing — every engine change from here on is yours to
> author and maintain. Re-adopting upstream later is a manual re-fork, not a
> command. Exhaust the first two lanes before taking the third.

./sc help                # all commands
```

![The ./sc enter shell picker — authenticate, then choose a shell and its per-flavor harness and model defaults before boot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedbjorn/subfloor/main/docs/images/cli-picker.png)

**Choosing a harness.** The boot artifact is dual-written every launch
(`CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `AGENTS.md` for the rest), so any installed harness
can boot the same shell. At launch, after you pick a shell: `--harness <name>` or
`HARNESS=<name>` forces one; otherwise, when more than one harness is on `PATH`,
you're prompted (default = your fork's `instance.json` harness). The pick is
per-launch and never written back — so two terminals can run the **same** shell on
different harnesses at once (one Claude Code, one OpenCode). A fork with a single
harness on `PATH` skips the prompt.

**`subfloor`.** One command across every fork — `subfloor <verb> [args]` — so
switching repos never changes the muscle memory. It is a shell function, not a
binary: `./sc install` writes it into `~/.bashrc` (bash) and
`~/.config/fish/functions/subfloor.fish` (fish), and every `./sc update`
refreshes it. Only bash and fish are wired. The function walks up from your
current directory to the enclosing checkout — the nearest ancestor holding `sc`
alongside `.sc-state/` or `.super-coder/` — and runs `./sc <args>` there, so it
works from any subdirectory of the fork and never needs a path. Every verb is
the `./sc` verb: `subfloor enter`, `launch`, `restart`, `down`, `update`,
`test`, `help`. `subfloor enter cc` boots one shell directly. Running
`./sc <verb>` from the checkout root is always identical — the function is a
convenience, never a second surface. `./sc alias` (re)installs it,
`./sc alias --remove` drops it, and `./sc alias --status` reports what is
installed where.

### Dev kit

> [!class2]
> **UI** Scripts · **Shells** dev (and any builder)

Every sandbox bakes a **seat toolchain** — `rg`, `sqlite3`, `curl`, Node 22 /
`npm`, and a Playwright + Chromium browser for E2E — but deliberately not a
fork's dependency, test, lint, or typecheck policy. A fork owns that policy in
its tracked `.subfloor/dev-kit.json`. The engine validates the declaration and
runs only the exact argv attached to each named hook; it does not discover
manifests, create `.venv`, install packages, or choose pytest/Ruff/mypy/vitest.

```bash
./sc deps          # exact fork-declared dependency hook
./sc test          # exact fork-declared test hook
./sc lint [paths]  # exact fork-declared lint hook plus literal caller args
./sc typecheck     # exact fork-declared typecheck hook
```

Boot reports `no fork dev kit declared` when the file is absent. An absent
declaration or missing named hook returns exit `78` with no fallback; invalid
policy exits `64`, an unavailable executable exits `126`, and a started child
keeps its shell-observable status. `SC_DEVKIT_ROOT`, `SC_DEVKIT_SEAT`, and
`SC_DEVKIT_HOOK` provide neutral context to the fork script. In Docker, a
fork-owned dependency hook should treat an out-of-repo interpreter as a
host-managed shared tree: verify it, but never pip-install into it.

A fork may also declare exact native Debian packages without maintaining an
extension Dockerfile:

```json
{"version":1,"sandbox":{"packages":{"apt":["libexample1","tool=1.2-3"]}}}
```

The list is bounded, canonical, and literal: no architecture qualifiers,
repository options, inferred names, fallback names, or relaxed pins. The engine
builds packages over an immutably identified baseline, proves the final image
with `dpkg-query` and no network, and writes one format-version-2 capability
receipt. Package-specific validation/build/proof failure leaves a healthy
sandbox untouched or selects the proven engine baseline. CLI and Flags then
show `native_packages=advisory` / `fork_readiness=degraded`; this advisory never
blocks core shell entry, roadmap completion, or runtime. Run `subfloor admin`
from the fork root to inspect evidence and prepare a reviewed tracked fix. The
FnB retains downstream update and live restart approval.

One boundary trips people up: **you work inside the sandbox container**, and the
app the FnB watches in their browser is a *separate*, host-supervised instance. To
see your own changes, start a dev server **inside** the container on
`0.0.0.0:$SC_DEV_PORT` — the launcher publishes it to `http://127.0.0.1:$SC_DEV_PORT`
on the host — and use `datasette <db.sqlite>` the same way to browse a SQLite DB in
a web GUI. Never restart the host stack from inside the sandbox; run your own
instance instead. (The Developer and Reviewer boot documents' `DEV TOOLS`
sections carry the active-seat detail; Planner can load `dev_kit` on demand. For
the FnB-facing review of a shell's UI changes, use
`./sc preview` — see *Shells & worktrees*.)

## Opt-in features

> [!class2]
> **UI** Scripts (VM wizard · Web Search key) · **Shells** see fork-local guidance when configured

Beyond the core loop, the engine ships **optional infrastructure**: a sidecar
or host broker controlled by a config block in the gitignored
`.super-coder/instance.json`. `./sc feature` is the front door to those blocks.
Fork-specific operating procedure is deliberately not a global grant; Planner
uses `fork_skill_design` to describe the fork's real capability as a
DB-canonical local skill.

```bash
./sc feature                 # list infrastructure + its config state
./sc feature enable pg       # wire an automatic block or print the link boundary
./sc feature disable pg      # remove that instance block
```

| Feature | Config block | What it gives the fork |
|---|---|---|
| **`pg`** | `pg` (auto-created) | A `postgres:17` sidecar on `sc-net`, with `DATABASE_URL` forwarded for the fork's **app**; the engine memory DB remains SQLite. |
| **`windows`** | `vm` (operator-linked) | The supplied Windows VM broker and its link boundary. |
| **`tailnet`** | `ts` (operator-linked) | The tailnet broker for declared build/deploy hosts without sharing its credential with the sandbox. |
| **`pm2`** | `pm2` (operator-linked) | The PM2 broker for a fail-closed set of host application processes. |

`enable pg` is complete in one step — the sidecar needs no host input, so the
block is auto-created and the next `./sc launch` starts it (data persists in a
named volume; `./sc pg-down` stops it, volume retained). `windows`, `tailnet`, and
`pm2` are **link-only**: their blocks carry host-specific, operator-verified
config (a ready VM, a tailnet scope), so `enable` prints exactly how to link.
The sections below describe the supplied mechanisms. A fork-specific test,
deployment, VM, database, or host procedure belongs in a differently named
local skill so engine updates preserve its body and grants.

Everything here can still be done by hand through `instance.json`; `./sc
feature` makes the supported block boundary visible and repeatable.

### Windows Test VM

> [!class2]
> **UI** Scripts · **Shells** dev + reviewer (loop) · admin (provision)

A fork that builds Windows software needs to test on **real Windows** —
installers, services, the registry, system-level behavior where Wine is useless.
This is an **opt-in** capability: the engine ships the *orchestration* (a verified
push → exec → capture → reset loop, a **host-side broker** that lets a sandboxed
shell drive the VM without holding the key, and a guided setup card in the Scripts
tab); you bring the *VM* — license, image, and OS install are yours and unreachable
from the tool. It is **link-only**: it assumes a ready VM and captures + validates
the connection to it, rather than building one for you. Off by default; nothing here
touches forks that don't opt in.

Config lives under a `vm` key in the gitignored `.super-coder/instance.json` —
**no secrets**, only a key *path* (`ssh_key_path`), never key material. The setup
card runs five live checks against the *candidate* config before you save, so what
gets persisted is verified, not hopeful:

| Check | Proves |
|---|---|
| `domain` | the VM exists and is visible to libvirt |
| `ssh` | key auth + remote exec work |
| `transfer` | artifact transfer works both ways |
| `snapshot` | the named clean snapshot exists for reset |
| `toolchain` | the box has the declared build toolchain |

**Setup is a three-role lifecycle, and the ordering *is* the design** — each role
can only act once the previous has:

```linear
User: SSH foothold :::class4 -> Admin: install kit :::class1 -> Snapshot = clean :::class3 -> Dev+Rev: run loop :::class2
```

1. **User (manual, once).** Bring up the VM, enable OpenSSH, authorize the key,
   share a transfer dir. The engine can't reach inside a fresh OS install — this
   bootstrap is irreducible.
2. **Operator provisioning (once / on toolchain change).** SSH in, install the
   build toolchain, verify each tool, **then** take the `clean` snapshot.
3. **Dev + reviewer loop.** Use the typed `./sc vm` surface to push → exec →
   capture → reset against that snapshot; a Planner may record fork-specific
   detail in a local skill.

> [!class4]
> **The one gotcha: provision *before* the snapshot, not after.** The clean snapshot
> is *pristine OS + toolchain*, and every test reverts to it — so the toolchain must
> already be baked in. Bump the toolchain → reinstall → re-snapshot. Provision after
> snapshotting and the first test hits an empty box.

**Set up a Windows test box — step by step**

The one-time host setup the link-only design assumes. Everything below runs on the
**host** (libvirt and the key live there); the fork only ever talks to the broker.

**0 · Prereqs.** A Linux host with libvirt/KVM and `virsh`, your user in the
`libvirt` group (so `virsh --connect qemu:///system` works without `sudo`), and a
Windows ISO + license — yours to bring.

**1 · Create the VM and install Windows.** Build a *system-scope* domain (survives
reboots, shared across sessions) with `virt-manager`, or:

```bash
virt-install --connect qemu:///system --name win-test \
  --osinfo win10 --ram 8192 --vcpus 4 --disk size=64 \
  --cdrom /path/to/Windows.iso --network network=default
```

Note the domain name (`win-test`) and the NAT IP it lands on libvirt's `default`
network (e.g. `192.168.122.x`) — you need both for the link.

**2 · Enable OpenSSH + key auth in the guest.** In an elevated PowerShell *inside*
Windows:

```powershell
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
Start-Service sshd; Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType Automatic
```

On the **host**, make a dedicated keypair (the *path* is what goes in the link —
never the key itself):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/sc_win_test -N ''
```

Put `~/.ssh/sc_win_test.pub` into the guest at
`C:\Users\<user>\.ssh\authorized_keys` (standard user) — or, for an **admin** user,
`C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys` with its ACL locked to
`Administrators`+`SYSTEM`. The default guest shell is `cmd.exe`; that's what `exec`
runs under. Confirm from the host: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/sc_win_test <user>@<ip> "ver"`.

**3 · Share a transfer dir (host → guest) for `push`.** `push` stages a build
artifact into a host directory the guest can read. Map one in with **virtio-fs**: add
a filesystem device to the domain pointing at your host `transfer_dir`, install the
virtio-fs guest driver (from the `virtio-win` ISO), and mount it to a drive letter.
Same-host only — cross-host `scp` is a later variant.

**4 · Provision the toolchain, then bake `clean` — in that order.** Boot the VM,
install your build kit from the fork's tracked manifest through an
operator-reviewed provisioning flow (or by hand — e.g. `dotnet tool install
--global wix`).
Then bake the offline baseline every test reverts to — one command, once the VM
is linked (step 5):

```bash
./sc vm-bake      # graceful shutdown → delete old `clean` → re-bake OFFLINE, guest left off
```

(Equivalent by hand: `virsh shutdown`, then `virsh snapshot-create-as <domain>
clean --description "pristine OS + toolchain"` — the snapshot must be taken
powered off.) Baking is **host-only, deliberately not a broker verb**: the
snapshot is the trust anchor every test reverts to, so the sandbox may run
*against* it but never redefine it. Provision and verify, then run this one
host command. Re-provisioning later is provision again → re-run `./sc vm-bake`
— and nothing "sticks" until it's baked, so never run a
test loop (which reverts) in between.

**5 · Link it.** Fill the `vm` block — via the Scripts → **Windows Test VM** wizard
(it live-tests every field before save) or by hand in `.super-coder/instance.json`:

```json
"vm": {
  "domain": "win-test",
  "ssh_host": "192.168.122.50", "ssh_port": 22, "ssh_user": "tester",
  "ssh_key_path": "~/.ssh/sc_win_test",
  "transfer_dir": "/var/sc/win-xfer",
  "snapshot": "clean",
  "libvirt_uri": "qemu:///system"
}
```

`libvirt_uri` is **optional** — set `qemu:///system` for a system-scope domain (the
default `qemu:///session` can't see it); omit it otherwise.

**6 · Start the broker.** `./sc feature enable windows` prints the operator-link
boundary; once the `vm` block is present, the broker comes up automatically
with `./sc launch`. A Planner can use `fork_skill_design` to publish any
fork-specific VM, GUI, or provisioning procedure as local guidance. You can
also drive the broker directly:

```bash
./sc vm-broker-up            # start in the background (also: auto-started by ./sc launch)
./sc vm-broker-install       # optional: a systemd --user unit, survives logout/reboot
```

A dev shell can now run the loop — `push → exec → capture → reset` — ending each run
with a `reset` that returns to `clean` and powers the VM **off**, so a multi-GB guest
never idles on the host.

**How the broker reaches the sandbox**

The piece that makes link-only work *from inside a container*. A fork's shells run in
the **sandbox container**; the VM sits on the host's libvirt NAT. The container has
**no route to it, no `virsh`, and no key** — and must never hold any of those. So it
doesn't touch the VM at all: it calls a small **host-side broker** that does.

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph C["sandbox container (no key, no virsh, no route)"]
    W["typed ./sc vm client"]:::class1
  end
  subgraph H["host"]
    B["vm-broker<br/>(holds key + virsh)"]:::class2
  end
  V["Windows VM"]:::class3
  W -->|"curl --unix-socket<br/>bind-mounted .sock"| B
  B -->|"ssh / scp"| V
  B -->|"virsh"| V
```

- The broker (`./sc vm-broker`) is a **host process** that holds the key path and has
  libvirt access — the one authority that touches the guest or the hypervisor,
  mirroring a credential broker.
- It listens on a **unix socket** in the engine dir
  (`.super-coder/run/vm-broker.sock`). The sandbox bind-mounts the whole repo at the
  *same absolute path* (`-v "$here:$here"`), so that socket file exists identically on
  both sides of the boundary.
- **Unix sockets are filesystem objects, not network-namespace objects** — so a
  process in the container `connect()`s to that socket path and reaches the host
  listener *through the shared mount*. No published port, no route across the NAT, no
  firewall hole, no token: the socket is `chmod 0600`, reachable only by processes
  that share the mount.
- The typed `./sc vm` client supplies status, start, push, exec, capture, and
  end-only reset commands. It reaches the broker without exposing
  the key; `virsh` remains host-only.
- **GUI driving rides the same seam.** Supported harness adapters inject the
  managed `windows-mcp` definition before launch. `./sc vm mcp up` starts and
  verifies the broker tunnel, local relay, and HTTP endpoint used by the
  fork-local GUI procedure — no persistent harness registration is required.

### Tailnet broker

> [!class2]
> **Shells** devops (reach hosts over the tailnet) · **UI** hand-edit the `ts` block (no wizard yet)

Sibling of the Windows VM broker, same shape, different backend: a **host-side
broker over a unix socket** that lets a sandboxed shell drive a **tailnet**
without ever holding a tailnet credential. A fork's shells run bound to
`sc-net`/127.0.0.1 only; a devops shell still needs to reach build/deploy hosts.
Rather than bake `tailscaled` into every fork's image (a reusable node
credential inside the sandbox + `CAP_NET_ADMIN`/`/dev/net/tun` — an isolation
regression), `tailscaled` and the tailnet identity stay on the **host** (already
`tailscale up`, authenticated once) and the broker exposes verbs over a
`chmod 0600` socket in the bind-mounted engine dir. The container `curl`s the
socket and holds nothing — no route, no firewall hole, no token.

One difference from the VM broker: a tailnet has **many** hosts, so the verbs are
parameterized by `{host, command}` and the `ts` block carries a fail-closed
`allowed_hosts` scope — a compromised sandbox can only reach hosts the fork has
declared. Config lives under a `ts` key in the gitignored
`.super-coder/instance.json` (**no secrets** — the host node's identity is the
credential and never leaves the host), coexisting with the `vm` block.
`./sc feature enable tailnet` prints the link boundary; the `ts` block itself
is yours to fill. Planner can document a fork-specific host workflow as a
local skill without placing the tailnet procedure in every installation.

```bash
./sc ts-broker-up            # start backgrounded (also auto-started by ./sc launch when a tailnet is linked)
./sc ts-broker-install       # optional: a systemd --user unit, survives logout/reboot
SOCK="$(./sc ts-broker-sock)"
curl -s --unix-socket "$SOCK" http://ts/exec -d '{"host":"build-box","command":"uptime"}'
```

### pm2 broker

> [!class2]
> **Shells** admin, devops (observe + manage the host app stack) · **UI** hand-edit the `pm2` block (no wizard yet)

Third sibling of the VM and tailnet brokers, same shape, different backend: a
**host-side broker over a unix socket** that lets a sandboxed shell observe and
manage the host's **pm2-supervised app stack** — the one a host-run
`make deploy` targets. From inside the sandbox there is no `pm2` binary and no
route to the host's `127.0.0.1`-bound ports, so without this the live-app half
of a deploy audit degrades to "ask the human to run `make status`". The broker
runs pm2 and curls the app's health URL **where they work — on the host** — and
exposes narrow verbs over a `chmod 0600` socket in the bind-mounted engine dir.

Every verb — even `status` — is fail-closed on the `pm2` block's `processes`
allowlist: the sandbox sees and bounces only what the fork declared, never the
host's full process table. `restart` (the deploy verb — it heals) rides the
allowlist alone; `stop`/`start` (an outage surface) additionally need
`"allow_lifecycle": true`; `delete` is not a verb at all. Config lives under a
`pm2` key in the gitignored `.super-coder/instance.json` (**no secrets**),
coexisting with the `vm`/`ts` blocks. `./sc feature enable pm2` grants the
operator link boundary; the block itself is yours to fill (link-only, like the
VM and the tailnet). Planner can publish any fork-specific process-management
procedure as a local skill.

```bash
./sc pm2-broker-up           # start backgrounded (also auto-started by ./sc launch when a stack is linked)
./sc pm2-broker-install      # optional: a systemd --user unit, survives logout/reboot
SOCK="$(./sc pm2-broker-sock)"
curl -s --unix-socket "$SOCK" http://pm2/status
curl -s --unix-socket "$SOCK" http://pm2/restart -d '{"proc":"myapp-api"}'
```

Full design: [`.super-coder/docs/pm2-broker.md`](../.super-coder/docs/pm2-broker.md).

### db broker

> [!class2]
> **Shells** dev · reviewer · planner (diagnostic reads) · **UI** `./sc db-init` scaffolds the `db` block (no wizard)

Fourth sibling, same shape, different backend: a **host-side broker over a unix
socket** for **read-only diagnostic reads of the fork's live app Postgres** —
without handing the sandbox a DSN or a network route. The sandbox's own pg
sidecar is deliberately empty (it's the dev/test target), so the live DB —
where the runtime telemetry that *confirms* a diagnosis lives — is unreachable
from inside; the cruder fixes (mount the DSN, open a route) both widen the
blast radius. Instead the DSN and the route stay host-side and the sandbox
gets one narrow verb.

Read-only is **enforced twice**: the DSN must be a read-only Postgres role
(the DB-enforced backstop; the broker also connects
`default_transaction_read_only=on`), and the broker rejects anything that
isn't a single `SELECT`/`WITH` before `psql` ever runs. Table scoping is
fail-closed on the `db` block's `allow_tables` (default: ops/telemetry only —
content/tenant tables are added only by explicit operator scope), every query
gets a row cap + statement timeout, and every call lands in an audit log. The
block carries **no secret** — it names an env var (`dsn_env`), which the
broker resolves host-side at query time; `instance.json` stays
sandbox-readable and safe.

```bash
./sc db-init                 # scaffold the "db" block + print the one-time host steps (RO role, GRANTs, export the DSN)
./sc db-broker-up            # start backgrounded (also auto-started by ./sc launch when a db is linked)
./sc db-broker-install       # optional: a systemd --user unit (its EnvironmentFile carries the DSN var)
SOCK="$(./sc db-broker-sock)"
curl -s --unix-socket "$SOCK" http://db/query -d '{"sql":"SELECT count(*) FROM skill_runs"}'
```

Unlike the other three, this one isn't a `./sc feature` entry — `./sc db-init`
plus the host steps it prints are the whole setup. Full design:
[`.super-coder/docs/db-broker.md`](../.super-coder/docs/db-broker.md).

> [!class2]
> **Reboot-proof it all in one verb.** Each host-side broker has a `-install`
> verb (a systemd `--user` unit). `./sc persist` installs and enables every
> broker linked to this fork, enables linger so they survive logout and reboot,
> and skips the rest with a reason. Idempotent — re-run any time.

### Web search (Tavily)

> [!class2]
> **UI** Scripts → **Web Search** (set · test · rotate · clear the key) · **Shells** every flavor that inherits common skills (`web_search`)

Every shell gets one web search verb, on every harness:

```bash
./sc search "<query>"                    # 5 results + a short synthesized answer
./sc search "<query>" --max 10 --depth advanced
./sc search "<query>" --json             # answer, results[] (title, url, snippet, score)
```

The shell never holds the key. `./sc search` posts the query to the engine API
with the shell's own bearer token; the **API process** calls Tavily with the
instance's key and returns the results — so a sandboxed shell needs no egress
and no credential beyond the one it already has. Nothing is persisted: no query
log, no result cache.

The key is held **host-side only**, in a mode-0600 `web_search.json` inside the
private instance-state directory (legacy floors: `.sc-state/local/`). It is
never written to `instance.json` (which is sandbox-readable), the engine DB,
the snapshot, or any render, and no API response ever carries more than its
last four characters. Set, test, rotate, and clear it from the Scripts tab:
**Web Search → configure…**. *test* probes Tavily with the key in the field (or
the stored one when the field is empty) before you save; *rotate* replaces the
stored key at once, and the next `./sc search` uses it — revoking the old key
at Tavily is yours to do. Shell credentials are refused on every config route.

An unconfigured instance is not an error state: `./sc search` tells the shell
exactly where the FnB sets the key, and the `web_search` skill tells the shell
to say so rather than improvise a key of its own.

## Review GUI

> [!class2]
> **UI** this IS the GUI — Chats · Shells · Roadmap · Docs · Flags · Worktrees · Map · Analytics · Scripts · **Shells** reviewer (every shell reads it)

A zero-dependency localhost GUI to review the substrate and hold normal browser
conversations. One stdlib Python server serves the JSON API, static UI, and
conversation event stream; no venv, no npm, no build step. Its nine tabs are
the windows the workflow above refers to:

| Tab | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Chats** | Durable normal conversations by shell: queued turns, streamed state, history, stars, Stop/Close recovery, and read-only Diff review. See [Browser conversations](#browser-conversations). |
| **Shells** | Each shell's role, mandate, editable `current_state`, identity, decisions, and skill grants. The default landing tab. |
| **Skills** | The skill catalogue (Repo · Substrate · Craft), with per-shell grant toggles and full content in a modal. |
| **Roadmap** | Features in a planning funnel (Brainstorm → … → Shipped), each with its spec tasks, linked docs, and flag blockers. Two views — a **Board** for editing a feature inline, and a **Flow** that groups features by work-stream and wires their blocker dependencies (see below). |
| **Docs** | Read-only `kind='doc'` documents; opens in md-converter for reading. |
| **Flags** | The blocker / follow-up tracker, grouped by feature, filterable Open/Resolved/All. |
| **Worktrees** | Live git-hygiene report — dirty worktrees, prunable merged branches, clean trees. |
| **Map** | The repo catalogue — language mix, file roles, dependencies, env vars — with a re-map button. |
| **Analytics** | Token & session analytics — per-class spend cards, a local-day graph, and the session history swept from each harness's on-disk usage data (see [Token & session analytics](#token--session-analytics)). |
| **Scripts** | Run the maintenance chores (snapshot, render, seed-skills, migrate, rebuild) from a button. |

The header's **save locally ⤓** button refreshes the ignored DB snapshot and
flat renders. Generated artifacts are never committed or published.

### Roadmap views — Board & Flow

The Roadmap tab renders the same feature rows two ways, toggled top-centre:

- **Board** — the planning funnel. Features sit in status columns (Brainstorm →
  In Progress → Next → Near Term → Long Term → Shipped, plus a Retired filter),
  and clicking one expands its inline editor — title, status, summary, and the
  spec-task checklist (the screenshot above).
- **Flow** — a left-to-right read of *what's committed and in what order*.
  Features are grouped into **work-streams** (a `projects` row doubles as a
  work-stream; `roadmap.project_id` is the link, NULL = Ungrouped), and the
  **blocker edges** between them (`feature_blockers`) draw as wires — a
  prerequisite must land before what it blocks. The graph is kept acyclic, so it
  reads cleanly stage by stage.

![Review GUI, Roadmap tab — Flow view: features grouped by work-stream across the planning stages, with blocker dependencies wired between cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedbjorn/subfloor/main/docs/images/roadmap-flow.png)

> [!class2]
> **Drive it from the shell, too.** `./sc mem roadmap project <feature_id> <work-stream>`
> assigns a feature's work-stream and `./sc mem roadmap depends <feature_id> --on <id>`
> sets its blocker edges (cycles refused) — the Flow view is the same data the
> CLI writes.

The server runs **inside the sandbox container** as its foreground process, so
`./sc launch` brings it up (printing its URL) and `./sc down` stops it. Under
the host runtime (`./sc runtime host`) the same two verbs start and stop it as
a supervised host process instead, with its log at `.super-coder/run/server.log`
(`./sc logs` tails it). `./sc enter` starts a CLI-owned shell session, while the Chats tab starts a
separate browser-owned conversation through the same harness adapters. The two
surfaces never own one shell concurrently. The port publishes to `127.0.0.1`
only.

```bash
./sc health    # curl /api/health
./sc serve     # run the server in the foreground on the host (no docker)
./sc ports     # show this fork's derived port
```

> [!class2]
> **Ports are derived per repo**, never fixed — a fork runs *inside* a host repo that may have its own dev server, and several forks can run at once. Each fork hashes its path to a stable port in the `88xx` band (clear of superCC 8000 / dos-arch 8001 and common host ports), persisted to a gitignored `.super-coder/instance.json` you can hand-edit. Two forks won't collide.

What you can do in the GUI: read everything; **create shells** (pick a flavor —
the factory grants its skill set and opens its first session); rename a
shell's `display_name` (✎ next to the name); edit a shell's
operational fields (`current_state`, `connections`, `workspace`) and skill
grants; edit the roadmap (linear status buckets, with toggle-filters) and
**non-frozen** documents; create and resolve flags. **seed and L&S are
read-only** — the laws say the shell curates them, so the API ships no endpoint
to write them at all. A **save locally ⤓** button re-serializes + renders after
edits into `.sc-state/local/`. There is no Git publication path for generated
instance state.

The **Scripts** tab lists the maintenance scripts (snapshot, render, seed-skills,
migrate, rebuild) — each with a description and a **run** button, so the common
chores work from the GUI without dropping to a terminal (rebuild prompts first,
since it discards un-snapshotted DB edits).

The live `.super-coder/shell_db.db` is **gitignored** and rebuilt from authored
schema/migrations plus the ignored local snapshot. See `.super-coder/README.md`
for the full model.

> [!class2]
> **Spec:** the founding design lives in the roadmap (`super-coder` feature row) and renders to `specs_sc/`.

### Token & session analytics

> [!class2]
> **Every token, every harness** — swept from what the CLIs already write to disk; no wrapper, no proxy, nothing in the model path

subfloor never calls a model itself — it launches harness CLIs — so token
telemetry is **pull-based**: each harness already writes usage data to disk
(claude transcripts — subagents included, codex rollouts, kimi wire logs, the
opencode DB, vibe session metas), and a per-harness parser normalizes what it
finds into one table, `session_token_usage` — one row per harness session ×
model, in four token classes (fresh input / output / cache read / cache write)
plus an informational reasoning split. `NULL` means *this harness doesn't
expose the class*; `0` means *measured zero* — parsers never invent zeros.

The sweep is incremental and idempotent — re-sweeping never double-counts —
and runs from four triggers:

- **every boot** — `./sc enter` sweeps before opening the session, so the view
  is current and the previous session's end time gets backfilled;
- **claude SessionEnd hook** — real-time capture the moment a session ends;
- **Analytics tab load** — the GUI sweeps on open;
- **manual** — `./sc analytics sweep [--harness <name>]`.

Sessions attribute to shells by cwd (a worktree maps to the shell whose
shortname names it) and archive time-window; anything ambiguous stays visibly
**unattributed** rather than guessed. The Analytics tab reads it all back:
per-class stat cards with harness/model filters, a local-day spend graph,
usage panels (favorite model by flavor, peak day, features and specs shipped,
docs outstanding), and a session history grouped by local day with per-session
token rollups.

The same reads are served as JSON at `/api/analytics/*` (session window +
cursor, token totals and series, filters) for anything outside the GUI.
